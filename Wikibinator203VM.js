                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007
<br><br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br><br>
                            Preamble
<br><br>
  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
<br><br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.
<br><br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br><br>
  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.
<br><br>
  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.
<br><br>
  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.
<br><br>
  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.
<br><br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
<br><br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br><br>
  0. Definitions.
<br><br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br><br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br><br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br><br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br><br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
<br><br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br><br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br><br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br><br>
  1. Source Code.
<br><br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
<br><br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br><br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br><br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br><br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
<br><br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
<br><br>
  2. Basic Permissions.
<br><br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br><br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br><br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
<br><br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br><br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
<br><br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
<br><br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br><br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br><br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br><br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br><br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br><br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
<br><br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".
<br><br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br><br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.
<br><br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
<br><br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br><br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
<br><br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.
<br><br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br><br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
<br><br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br><br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.
<br><br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
<br><br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br><br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
<br><br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
<br><br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
<br><br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
<br><br>
  7. Additional Terms.
<br><br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br><br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br><br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br><br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br><br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br><br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br><br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or
<br><br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br><br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.
<br><br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br><br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
<br><br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
<br><br>
  8. Termination.
<br><br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
<br><br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br><br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
<br><br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
<br><br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br><br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br><br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br><br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br><br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br><br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br><br>
  11. Patents.
<br><br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br><br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
<br><br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br><br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
<br><br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br><br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
<br><br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br><br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br><br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br><br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br><br>
  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
<br><br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.
<br><br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br><br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br><br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of

will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<br><br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
<br><br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br><br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br><br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br><br>
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br><br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br><br>
  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.
<br><br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

implement op (getLocalId128 x) gives the 4 ints (in js) x().idA x().idB x().blobFrom and x().blobTo.
blobFrom and blobTo are both 0 in any node thats not a cbt so you only need half the id then.
Use it in a treemap (Lambda [...] ...) of #SomeName to fn, for use as a code editor.
Strings that fit in an id256 dont need to be hashed (which is slow, .0001 to .0000001 per second per hash id).
Using an idmaker that uses literalinid (or (typeval "text/plain;charset=utf8" TheBits)) or hashidofanyfn,
together as just whatever (AnIdMaker SomeFn) returns, could view code being made and deleted,
much faster without having to hash it, but can only be
run in vm.stackAllow* mode, some dirty mode (not purely deterministic)
depending on salt of course for nondeterministic recursion and caching.
The localid of a fn may differ from other times that fn is observed,
but for the same localid in the same VM run (til wikibinator203 VM is restarted),
there is at most 1 val, so [localid128 many-to-1 dedupedFn (within same run of VM)].
For each localid128 there is at most 1 dedupedFn, until restart VM then those may change.
Each VM running simultaneously can be running a different "VM run",
so the nondeterministic localid128s should be limited to when vm.mask_stackAllowReadLocalIds (now 1 of 5 kinds of clean/dirty).

TODO for vararg syntax use A[B C D] meaning (A [B C D]), where A B C and D are #Names.
In general if you dont put a space before ( { [ or < then it means a call.
This simplifies _ , ? and maybe the first . like in .abc.def .
(?2 (?2 (? z) y) length) is written as something like <z y length>,
but you could also write that as A[z y length] if A is the #Name of a fn that does (?2 (?2 (? z) y) length) with [z y length],
as it would be (A [z y length] [...stream...]).
I'm willing to sacrifice the code being a little longer, having to write (W (X (Y Z))) with spaces before the (s, instead of (W(X(Y Z))),
but the new syntax also allows W(X (Y Z)) or W(X(Y Z)) since lack of a prefix space implies calling.
You cant have 2 names touching eachother, except if its a builtin name like _ , ?.
W(X(Y Z))   //smaller, but more complex to parse. maybe more confusing to read?
(W(X(Y Z))) //bigger
Maybe also allow : between #Names, to mean the same thing as lacking a space between them, but you cant write WX to mean (W X), so you write W:X.
/*But what about direction? What does W:X:Y mean, (W (X Y)) or ((W X) Y)? Would having 2 symbols fix that, like W<X<Y vs W>X<Y vs W<X>Y ?
W<Anything means W before Anything. W>Anything means W after Anything??? So what would W<X<Y mean? W first, so (W X<Y).
What would W>X<Y mean? W after X<Y, but what does that mean? X<Y and X>Y both mean (X Y), so W>(X Y). Its (W (X Y)).
What would W>X>Y mean? W after X>Y. so (W (X Y)).
What would W<X<Y<Z mean? (W X<Y<Z). (W (X Y<Z)). (W (X (Y Z))).
Wait... which one means (((W X) Y) Z) ?
Forget that < > stuff above. Do it this way instead....

/*
> means ) and implies the ( happened before it.
< means ( and implies the ) happens after it.
W<X<Y<Z means W(X(Y(Z with some )s implied, which means (W (X (Y Z))).
W>X<Y<Z means W)X(Y(Z, which means (W X (Y Z)) ???? that doesnt seem right. might be right. try few more examples...
W>X>Y<Z  W)X)Y(Z  ((W)X)Y(Z)  ((((W)X)Y)(Z))  (W X Y Z). Its just (W X Y Z). The last < vs > never matters, since theres only 2 things. W>X>Y:Z .
But if the last < vs > doesnt matter, how would i write (W X (Y Z)) ?
Maybe this syntax doesnt work either. Or maybe W>X>Y>Z means (W X Y Z), and W>X>Y<Z means (W X (Y Z)) ? What parsing rule could detect that?
How many possible trees are there of W X Y Z that have each of those once and occur in that order? Write them all...
(((W X) Y) Z)
((W X) (Y Z))
((W (X Y)) Z)  W<X<Y>Z  problem, these 2 seem to need the same syntax
(W (X (Y Z)))  W<X<Y>Z  problem, these 2 seem to need the same syntax
*
Figure out more syntaxes later. For now just use W:X:Y:Z to mean (W X:Y:Z) aka (W (X Y:Z)) aka (W (X (Y Z))).
That will make it easier to read and small enuf that can make custom syntaxes by prefixing by a fn that does parsing (and can Evaler optimize some of them).
Example: (Y[A B C] D) could do the same as ({A B C} D) if Y is a fn that takes a [...] of any size and does what {...} does.
Similarly Y{A B C} or Y(A B C), but [...] is the most useful for vararg.
Keep <...> for the ?2 and ? syntax, as in "(?2 (?2 (? z) y) length) is written as something like <z y length>" but I'm not completely sure of that part
as I'm still figuring out how these parts of syntax fit together.
..
(=d .z.abc .i .z.y?i) //z.abc[i] = z.y[i];
...could be written as...
ED[.z.abc .i .z.y?i]   where ED is a #Name of a fn that does with [...] that same thing when it gets 1 more param., 







lambda
ja code generator for mutlam. test it on a Fo loop with hypot3 (a derived mutlam of 3 params) and the js code should inline it as Math.sqrt(Square?x...codegen y.. z..) without heap alloc in loop, by detecting its all doubles. add optimization to often detect if something always returns doubles.
Mut.m is js {}.
Mut.d is Float64Array overlapping buffer with Int32Array and Float32Array. Mut.e is a double. Mut.k is dedupedfn and Mut.o is whichopmutspacenum which together are the primarykey. Mut.j is dup fn. i might add more fields later such as jj being js [] of dup fn. (ObKeyVal ob key val) (ObCbt ob acbt) etc. cache mutevaler of Mut.k andor mutevaler of Mut.j?
..
For MutLam params, use a js {} (either pooled and emptied after used or new {} each mutlam call) of varnameorstringid to val. val is Mut or double. use ?x for mutlam var x, and.x for rootstate Mut.m.x. i could, but dont use {}.prototype being lower {} on mutlamcallstackwhichisjystjsstack, cuz namespaces are only supposed to see their own vars. can still share Muts as params of mutlam, in Mut.m.varnameorstringid.
...
(;[a b c] d) means (a ;[a b c] d), or maybe (a [a b c] d), as a way of defining vararg and custom syntaxes. or maybe <a b c d> means (a [b c d]) if a is (some certain op with FuncBody param).
The problem this is meant to solve is <.xy .zz {...} ...>, as way to getvar ? and ?2, is not general enuf cuz theres =dd =d =j and getters of those etc. need general vararg syntax and im willing to pay an extra char for it. maybe A<b c d> instead of writing it as <A b c d>, and A is a #Name, and if you dont give a fn before the < then its ? and ?2 default syntax. will optimize for that.
..
yes, do that, but as []... A[B C D] is (A [B C D]). more generally if you dont put a space before ( or { or < or [ then its automatically a call. that simplifies , and _ and maybe the first . but im unsure if i want to ((...) (...) (...))

Mut has to compile to using string keys in js {} map, since otherwise i'd have to make my own stack which would be slow.
The strings can be: anything that starts with a lowercase letter, such as varABC or x hello etc,
or a text form of a 256 bit global id, or a deduped localId.
Otherwise it should be a double used as an int for Float64Array (or maybe Int32Array in some cases).
FIXME if dedup a localId, then its garbcoled, how could i know to use the same id again if its made again? I wouldnt,
	THEREFORE deduped ids only verify that at most 1 deduped id exists at a time for a certain forest shape,
	but it does not guarantee its the same 64 bits if its garbcoled and allocated again as a deduped id,
	so during opmut, if using deduped id64 that way, dont allow garbcol during opmut,
	and dont reuse compiled evalers that depend on a string for of deduped localid such as 'n'+node.idA+'_'+node.idB.
	Could use a global id256, such as around 46 chars (is that base64 or base58?), in js {} map key,
	but that would be slow. Mostly it would be small var names like abc and x and double indexs.
	
	
This depends on ability to make var names like [ballA x] which is (infcur ballA x), var names that are fns in general,
and I'm unsure how to compile it to js code, so needs redesign...

Instead of each mut in [...muts...] being a key and around 4 vals (of type double, double[], fn, mut[], etc),
each mut is a map, so things come in threes: ob key val, like mutA mutB mutC means mutA[mutB] = mutC,
and similar for Float64Array except thats stored in pairs of: mutA cbt.
LambdaParamsStream op would give its own params as keys of some given ob,
such as (LambdaParamsStream (pair s "hello") (Lambda [a b c] 10 15))

Old: (= ?arrayAC {,NewDoubles {,* ?aSize ?cSize}})

/*TODO consider using fn directly as mut, such as (anyDoubleAsWhichopmutspace anyFn)
or as (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn), so (MutId whichOpmutSpace) would be used for a call of Opmut.
There would be mutable fields in fn in general, that would get erased after Opmut call,
and fn wouldnt be able to read or write them (only Opmut could read and write them as mutable optimization
of immutable/stateless calculation). A vm.OpmutState would just need to somehow remember which fns
have mutable state, so when that specific Opmut call ends, their mutable contents can be cleared.
Example fn: (MutId whichOpmutSpace (MutId whichOpmutSpaceB anyFnB)), since its all fns.
Only dedupedFns would be allowed as mut keys, but their fields dont have to be deduped.
So all objects visible to fns would be either fn or double,
and double is a cbt64 or (todo? wrapper of it to say its a double of those 64 bits).
fn.e would be a double.
fn.ee would be a Float64Array.
fn.ii would be an Int32Array that shares same ArrayBuffer as fn.ee, unless they're both frozen and empty.
fn.j would be a dup fn.
fn.jj would be an Array of dup fn.
fn.m would be a deduped fn.
fn.mm would be an Array of deduped fn.
FIXME in what lambdize returns (a function), its prototype cant be changed.
	BUT I might could put something in the prototype of functions in general.
Maybe its best to just put 1 mutable field in fn, the Mut, since function prototypes dont work like {} prototypes.
At least that way theres at most 1 Mut per fn. Also, a dup fn could still have a Mut,
but it would be shared among all the dups (and the 1 deduped of it).
..
(MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn) could automatically force instant dedup of
MutId, (MutId whichOpmutSpace), and (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn), and (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn)
be at 7th param (where op is known) and 8th param infloops, so you could know by o8 that it is a (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn).
..
Theres 2 ways Opmut can call itself:
(1) OpmutOuter uses a new whichOpmutSpace (VM chooses one not used yet in by this run of the VM) and
	an empty namespace or given namespace of [...muts...] snapsshot.
(2) OpmutInner is called on an existing mutable state and returns a fn or double.
	This allows you to make new funcs that work in a mutable state instead of having to inline their parts.
..
Garbcol of mutable contents of a (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn), which lets call that a fnmut,...
A fnmut is any fn thats a (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn), known by its o8 can be any of 4 values since MutId is at param 5.
At any specific time and specific VM (mutable parts arent shared across VMs but snapshots of them are),
	a fnmut either has mutable parts or not.
For each unique (MutId whichOpmutSpace), I need a set of fnmuts that have mutable state.
That set could be stored in mutable vars in (MutId whichOpmutSpace), which is created at start of an OpmutOuter call.
I could easily put a bit field in each fn to say it has such mutable state, but I need the ability to find them fast,
and during Opmut I MIGHT want the ability to remove their mutable state?
OR, is it ok to not garbcol any of it until the Opmut call ends (which is likely a small fraction of a second)?
If garbcol only at end of (small fraction of a second) whole outermost OpmutOuter call,
then I only need 1 set of fnmuts.
THEREFORE, vm.fnmutsWithState = anyFnmut, a linkedlist using someFnmut.prevFnmut ptrs, only between deduped fns.
At end of the outermost Opmut call, just loop over vm.fnmutsWithState and free the memory in their mutable parts,
but dont free those fns since thats still controlled by FuncallCache.
PROBLEM: This kind of opmut garbcol could prevent FuncallCache from doing its normal garbcol during opmut,
which aFuncallCache.touch (TODO) does it by leastRecentlyUsed.
A basic way to limit that is a kind of gas* for putting state in opmut nodes,
or maybe just reuse the stackTime and stackMem kinds of gas*.
..
THEREFORE, add a prevFnmut field to Node or maybe to fn (which lambdize returns), TODO which???.
..
TODO I was going to have aFn(aMut) vs aFn(anotherFn) know the difference between mut/stateful and fn/stateless,
and still use them as javascript lambdas (call with parens).
How would that work if (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn) is both a mut and a fn?
It would have to be a fn in OpmutInner and OpmutOuter are those fns???
But theres still the [...muts...] immutable/stream/snapshot of it, vs the mutable datastructs themselves.
..
Should there be a few kinds of Mut, one for mutable Float64Array
(such as (MutDoubles anyDedupedFn) would be key, and its value is mutable),
one for mutable array of nondeduped fns, one for mutable double, etc?
I could have a different o8 (or at most a few o8s) for each kind.
But could it be done efficiently?
They could all have the same fields but some of those fields could be frozen as empty arrays etc,
which could be detectable by the o8.
..
OR... just use a [] of such fnmuts, and have a bit in each fnmut to say if its in the [] or not.
Maybe fn would have an int to say which index in the [] (vm.fnmuts = [], just 1 of them per VM) its in,
and could have a Float64Array parallel to it.
If a fn loses its mutable state during opmut, since it knows its index, it could be replaced by the highest index fnmut.
There might also be an Array() parallel to that, with various other mutable things in it, instead of in a Mut.
There might be advantage to this way, since an int could be used instead of a Mut.
Such ints could be allocated using (MutId whichOpmutSpace anyFn), so you could have things like (MutId whichOpmutSpace [ball5 x]).
Fns wouldnt get to know what those ints are since they're reference not pointer,
but basically as internal vm optimization you could say give me the int for (MutId whichOpmutSpace [ball5 x]),
and it would check if that fn has such an int field else would allocate one.
Careful not to change such ints during a primitive optimization that uses them.
Maybe just the infcurCallPairs would make good keys, since I can actually allocate ints for those really fast in an Int32Array.
But do I want fns as keys, or just the combos of var names like [you can even write a sentence here [ball5 x] abc 22] could be a key?
Remember, any token that starts with a lowercase letter and has no whitespace (might be few other excluded chars)
is a utf8 (or is it utf16?) string literal of itself.
If I want the ability to optimize mutable maps of fn to fn, then I must support fns as keys, not just combos of infcur.
..
..
..
OR...
consider using just the hash ids of nodes as mut keys, such as 192 bits of hash and 32 bits of array index (of maybe up to 4 kinds of arrays) in it?
concat(192bitsHash,32bitsOfMakingATempIdOfThose192Bits,2BitsWhichArrayType,30BitsArrayIndex) is 256 bit key. could loop over 30BitsArrayIndex.
could look up the 192 bits in an Int32Array, using 32bitsOfMakingATempIdOfThose192Bits.
Or maybe I want an immutable 256 bit space including arrays, thats all possible immutable states,
so you could for example have a certain 192bitsHash..30BitsArrayIndex point at 5000 of 192bitsHash..30BitsArrayIndex ???
An advantage over 256 bit keys is garbcol is alot easier. but you cant have 32bitsOfMakingATempIdOfThose192Bits in the hashes,
just as an optimization, so that part would have to be set to 32 0s before hashing.
What if Mut has 2 such 192 bit ids, one as you just make it up randomly (whichOpmutSpace) and the other can be the id of a fn.
fn's bizeInt field could be used as "2BitsWhichArrayType,30BitsArrayIndex" in some cases?



/*
Add 2 more int fields, for size of val_dupDoubles and val_dupMuts,
and include wikibinator203 ops (which can have a max of 128 ops) to,
given a Mut, pop 2 doubles off its stack then push a multiply, UNLESS the Float64Array in the Mut is not big enough and in that case
use something like objectThatReturns0ForAllFieldValues for all doubles outside its range etc is constant 0,
and let stackSize wrap as twosComplement of int32, or something like that. i dont want to auto enlarge the array
cuz that might slow it down when doing a sequence of such ops.
Similar, some ops for copying between the double or Mut stacks in multiple Muts.
Could use a Mut as an array of such "multiple Muts" such as having 3 stacks which is a simple way to do permutations.
TODO figure out details of that while using it to derive (from these up to 128 ops) the y10x10rgb12 voxel system,
or y10x10bright4 or y9x9rgb6 etc would fit in a float32 which GPU.js is limited to but CPU can do ints such as y10x10rgb12.




TODO use 1 char long field names, but other than that, I like this design,
and it will go in vm.ops.Mut which has these 5 things (excluding whichOpmutSpace cuz fns cant see that),
and TODO make a hashtable in it, as a proofofconcept, combining val_dupMuts and val_dupDoubles (or maybe Int32Array view of it?).
FIXME would it cause a problem to have to allocate dedupedFn for each potentially nondedupedFn?
You could, in the worst case, dedup that same fn and use it as its own key,
or simpler would be to just count doubles up from 0 to use as keys since every double can be viewed as a dedupedFn.
TODO allocate range of idA_idB for dedupedFns, and that range will be a subset of nonnormedNaNs
	(or maybe the nonnormed negative infinities) where idA is high 32 bits idB is low 32.
Mut = function(dedupedFn, whichOpmutSpace){
	this.key_dedupedFn = dedupedFn;

It appears that if the first 13 bits are 1 (UPDATE: 14?), then thats never used (a subrange of nonnormed negative infinity), leaving me 51 bits for ids.
Anything that doesnt start with 13 1s is viewed as a double.
Use the first 3 of those 51 bits to choose between 8 kinds of things, of up to 2^48 possible ids each?
Those 8 things: split on deduped/dup, so 4 things left: literalBitsThatFitInId64, fn, other(prefixByteOfOther_*), reservedForFutureExpansion.
I might want more than the first 3 bits to do that.

Which fields should Mut have?...
..
Outerjoin these:
deduped or dup.
fn or bits.
list or one.

Write them out...
key: deduped fn.
key: deduped whichOpmutSpace, but fns cant see this, is only to separate the Muts per Opmut call.
val: deduped fn, actually a Mut, (can put any of the dup parts here, since the only way to dedup something in this system is as a fn)
val: dup fn
val: dup fn[], could implement a hashtable in this. The Array() and fn are both dup.
val: dup Mut[], could implement a hashtable in this. the Array() is dup, but the Mut is not.
val: deduped double, deduped by Node.idA and .idB, if they are anything except the high and low bits of a nonnormed NaN, are a double.
val: dup Float64Array, dup ArrayBuffer (and views of it like Float64Array Int32Array Float32Array Uint8Array)
//val: dupFnSize?
//val: arrayBufferSize?
cache: Int32Array, sharing the Float64Array.buffer.

Or maybe each Mut should have only 1 kind of val, except a second kind of val tells which kind that is,
	and Mut.prototype puts empty stuff in for the rest, such as fn[0].

	Remember, I have code (objectThatReturns0ForAllFieldValues) to

		so can do that instead of & or min/max memory fencing, by putting it as prototype
		
	Dont forget to set prototype to null (Object.setPrototypeOf) so cant access __proto__ etc
		which would allow things to escape into the outer browser tab sandbox.

/*stream snapshot is [...] of
[cbtNotNecessarilyDeduped doubleThatIsOrWillBeDeduped fnThatIsOrWillBeDeduped fnNotNecessarilyDeduped fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped],
though I might change the order of those 5 things. The last has to be fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped.
Its basically 4 maps in 1, of fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped to the other 4 things.
If you want to dedup something else, you can make it into a key in another Mut.
Mut key is fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped_and_intordoubleOfWhichMutSpace.
intordoubleOfWhichMutSpace is only created in Opmut and lambdas dont see it.
fnThatIsOrWillBeDeduped is, in Opmut, a Mut(fnThatIsOrWillBeDeduped,same intordoubleOfWhichMutSpace).
Mut = function(fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped, intordoubleOfWhichMutSpace){
	fn key; //fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped
	number whichMutSpace; //intordoubleOfWhichMutSpace. lambda cant see this. its just for dedup of Mut, since you can do more than 1 Opmut at a time by recursion.
	FIELDS:
	Float64Array (or sharing buffer with Int32Array Uint8Array etc? those might also be fields?) cbtNotNecessarilyDeduped;
	number doubleThatIsOrWillBeDeduped;
	Mut fnThatIsOrWillBeDeduped;
	fn fnNotNecessarilyDeduped;
	
	
	//MAYBE THESE FIELDS:
	//Int32Array sharing buffer with the cbtNotNecessarilyDeduped;
	//Float32Array sharing buffer with the cbtNotNecessarilyDeduped;
	//Int16Array sharing buffer with the cbtNotNecessarilyDeduped;
	//Uint8Array sharing buffer with the cbtNotNecessarilyDeduped;
};
Getting Lambda params this way can reuse some constant [cbtNotNecessarilyDeduped doubleThatIsOrWillBeDeduped fnThatIsOrWillBeDeduped],
maybe this one: [0 0 u], where number literals such as 0 mean a raw cbt64 of those double/float64 bits,
or maybe [(0 0) 0 u] since that makes it clear which is the array ((0 0) is a cbt128 and actually wouldnt be displayed that way since its just raw bits),
or maybe [(pi e) 0 u].
and just append (since its an infcur) fnNotNecessarilyDeduped fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped to it.
In Lambda params, fnAsKeyThatIsOrWillBeDeduped is key and fnNotNecessarilyDeduped is val.
The not necessarily deduped part of val is important so it can efficiently wrap large arrays made by GPU.js or compiled javascript code etc.
The logic of the universal lambda function (combinator), while clean at least, works exactly the same if things are deduped or not, except for efficiency.

Should "number whichMutSpace" just be an idA_idB like in Node? No, cuz its not going in the same dedup map as fns.
There will be 3 dedup maps, for: fn, FuncallCache, Mut. Or maybe 1 dedup map per whichMutSpace.
fn is deduped by: idA idB blobFrom blobTo, so 4 ints.
FuncallCache is deduped by: 2 fns and a StackStuff, so 4+4+5=13 ints.
Mut is deduped by: fn and a whichMutSpace, so 4+1or2=5or6 ints
(UPDATE: change that 4 to 2 cuz blobFrom and blobTo will always be 0 in a perfectDeduped fn, so ...=3or4),
not sure if I need 1 or 2 ints (or a double) for number of Mut spaces during 1 run of the VM
(so could go on for up to a month or might even be able to run for years without restarting if you're not creating alot of objects often, as the bottleneck on that is theres only around 2^52 possible blobs+nonblobFns (idA_idB that fit in nonnormed NaN bits, else are a double), or the VM boots runs and ends in a tiny fraction of a second as its very lightweight). And even if you do restart the VM, you can save state and continue from where it left off. Alternatively to feeling the effects of restarting a server, you may snapshot the state of a server at runtime and boot another server using that state and, in theory, get them in sync, then drop either of them and continue from that, normally dropping the older one since it uses bigger values of idA_idB which are in danger of running out of approx 2^52 number of ids. Or, you could in theory run 5 VMs at once in sync, even if all 5 are written in a 5 different programming languages, though if they are 5 different OS processes you're likely to get much higher latency (less latency in linux for things like that, I'd guess, but still OS processes are slow).
You'll be able to sync, verify, redundantly mirror, load-balance, etc, the same ways inside 1 computer as you can across the Internet.
..
Since Opmut might be called on many small things, I want at least another 52 bit id space (or 64, but keep in mind it has to be hashable if multiple OpmutSpaces are in the same hashtable, which I'm undecided if they will be or not in this VM).

Theres 4 kinds of vals in Mut, so I need 4 chars for reading and writing them...
These buttons are easy to push: / ;

Example stream:
[
	[0 5 u u [ballA x]]
	[0 10 u u [ballA y]]
	[0 6 u u [ballB x]]
	[0 5.1 u u [ballA x]]
]


TODO syntax to only display [a b c] once in [[a b c d e] [a b c x y]].
[([a b c]#Ab d e) (Ab x y)] does that, BUT how would it automatically know to display it that way instead of: [[a b c d e] [a b c x y]]?

Maybe I should use...
[
	(Mut 0 5 u u [ballA x])
	(Mut 0 10 u u [ballA y])
	(Mut 0 6 u u [ballB x])
	(Mut 0 5.1 u u [ballA x])
]
and (Mut 0 0 u)#Mu so (Mu val key) is (Mut 0 0 u val key), and those last 2 params are what Lambda params become, the way it gives them to Opmut.
Its not a complete Mut, cuz it still needs whichMutSpace. Its a snapshot of a Mut. Fns correctly cant see whichMutSpace.




OLD:
TODO change stream/[] [keyA valA keyB valB...] to [keyALambda valALambda valADoubleRaw valADoubleArrayRaw keyBLambda ...] which will mirror Mut having intOrDouble_whichMutSpace and keyALambda as primaryKey and the 3 vals as val. And make there be 3 char prefixs of the 3 vals instead of just ?{...keyALambda...}, and keep using the Syntax described below.








/*
Maybe start with the approx (2^(1.5^height)) space of sparse keys (of binforest shapes), and double values from -1 to 1??? I could easily alloc ints to a set of keys from (2^(1.5^height)) in realtime and use a double[] of that expanding size. But that seems to make it harder to reuse "musical instrument parts" cuz its too low level.



...................
...................

TODO start with (using "key valLambda valDouble valDoubleArray") making simple small musical instrument parts that interact with eachother thru double[] in double[] out fn otherState, CUZ the density of interestingToHumans patterns of that is much higher than the density for games. If you take part of one game and put it in an other game, its likely to unbalance the gameplay and make it not fun, except some rare times it would make it more fun, but if you take part of one musical instrument and combine it with other instruments, it far more often sounds interesting. Do this with opmut. I have some existing instruments in my code from years ago in various opensource, that I can rebuild as a basic start. I still plan to do games, science tools, number crunching in GPU, etc, but I need a fun proofofconcept first. Theres alot of strange sound effects that most people done know how to make, that they could make and share and combine into new lambdas as musical instrument parts and so on... so the demand is there (as in supply and demand) and supply very very low, for alot of instrument parts. Theres high supply of some few experts using them in recordings, but very low supply of just anyone's ability to make these sounds based on realtime input. That niche appears to be the strongest place for wikibinator203 to start. TODO maybe reproduce the first 18 seconds of "the who - who are you" like in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYb_nqU_43w as lambdas (before the voice, just the electronic instruments), as a basic demo? If I could make lambdas that do (especially with a few params to vary in each to make it sound different), approximations of a few hundred small pieces of existing music like that, might be interesting enough to motivate people to build more things with it. Its all equations to me. Realtime input only, so only things simple enough to move the hands etc on computer/etc controls to change the sound in realtime. Focus on sound effects of a small fraction of a second, a "kind of sound" instead of something that varies based on a sequence of notes. Optimize for a powOf2 number of sound samples per second, such as 256. 256 is the smallest that WebAudioAPI allows??? [[["The bufferSize parameter determines the buffer size in units of sample-frames. If it’s not passed in, or if the value is 0, then the implementation will choose the best buffer size for the given environment, which will be constant power of 2 throughout the lifetime of the node. Otherwise if the author explicitly specifies the bufferSize, it MUST be one of the following values: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384." -- https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/ 2022-3-18]]]. Optimize to do a fast-varying set of musical instrument parts (made of lambdas) in CPU L1 cache. Linux is usually lower lag for sound than windows.
..
DETAILS...
..DETAILS........
..
Consider using unit (length 1) vectors, or vectors where all dimensions/dims range -1 to 1 (like i did in audivolv), of approx a googolplex number of sparse dims, which means lambdas from height 0 to approx height a few thousand (even though they could easily go into the millions of height) as key and double/float64 as value. Could define lots of musical instruments in that, as a space of dims big enuf that they would rarely accidentally overlap and interfere with eachother. Maybe do it like audivolv did with a double[30] or double[100] etc, except in that bigger sparse dimensional space. I could, very soon if I wanted to (so many details to think about...) have such a music system working at around, I estimate, 100 million flops in CPU. Since sound only needs about 20k samples per second for 1 channel sound, to sound "good enough" for music etc, that leaves 5k flop per sample. More generally, this could be a kind of sparse dimensional vector. I could make 5k javascript objects or 5k int pointers into a Float64Array, though sparseness might have it jumping around alot more than th at. So the combined state of a set of musical instruments being played would, very very very sparsely, be, in abstract math, a number from 1 to a googolplexplex ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/googolplexian ).
Each musical instrument part might read and write a few specific dims, similar to how audivolv does it but not limited to those specific sound transforms, and have a sort value to say what order it happens in the sequence of musical instrument transforms that are turned on or off.
...

Some useful sound transforms I've made over the years...
.......
decaymax, as in jsoundcard example code.
the audivolv transforms of a few doubles to the same number of doubles, where all those doubles range -1 to 1.
...
The most efficient connection between sim musical instruments I know of, is a state space of double[] with 4 ranges: inputs, state, tempVars, outputs. [inputs,state]->[nextState,outputs]. This could be generated many possible ways, such as in theory by lambdas.
...
PROBLEM... how to reset dim_as_key/double_as_val to some random double or to 0 as val??? cuz dont want it to get stuck.




TODO start with simple 2d games that fit on 1 screen with no scrolling.

TODO??? make stream/[] datastruct be blocks of 4 things instead of 2???: key valLambda valDouble valDoubleArray,
	so it aligns with Mut datastruct. (=D ?arrayAC ?D?_something {...}), or something like that.
Or maybe an op that infloops unless its params are those 4 types (checks for nonnormed doubles etc), and [...] of that?
[(thatOp keyLambda valLambda valDouble valDoubleArray) (thatOp keyAnotherLambda.... ].
Could do it as 3 of [key val key val]..., but 1 of [key vala valb valc] would be more efficient on average.
Have 3 prefix chars for reading, and maybe 3 other prefix chars for writing, those 3 vals of each keyLambda,
instead of just ? in ?x etc. writing into valDoubleArray takes an extra param during opmut.
Opmut verifies incoming stream/[] is that datastruct before running the For/DoWhile/etc.
Could instead do it by varargAx, but that makes it potentially infinitely expensive to verify.

{,Fork ?aSize ,?a ,ForkBody} ???

yes (=D ?sum ,0) no (= ?sum ,0)

3 types: fn (the most general), double_asRawCbt64, double[]_asRawCbtOfPowOf2Size ???
	These types are used in opmut.
	
TODO??? replace Math.sin Math.exp * etc, by 2 ops, one of (double,double)->double and one of double->double, with an extra param of deriving those bits? Problem is, theres alot of fast hardware out there, that people are using already, which has nondeterministic roundoff, some uses float32, some approximates ops using combos of other ops, etc.

Syntax:
(_[a b c] x) means ((Seq [a b c]) x) which does (c (b (a x))), for any vararg in the [].
Xyz means the (...)#Xyz constant lambda, since it starts with a capital letter (or things like =D or =).
abc means 'abc' since it starts with a lowercase letter.
{a b} means (s a b)
{a b c} means {{a b} c} aka (s (s a b) c), aka in javascript this code will actually work: s(s(a)(b))(c).
,a means (t a), often used like ({,+ getX getY} treemapZ) which evals to (+ (getX treemapZ) (getY treemapZ)).
abc.def<<ghi<5>>> FIXME i might not need this syntax anymore and would write ?[abc def] or something like that?
<<>> gets from something like what {} means in javascript, a map of string to thing.
<> gets from a Float64Array. These 2 things are used in small blocks of javascript-like code that compiles to javascript but blocks access to Float64Array.buffer etc so it can guarantee that all lambda calls halt within chosen limits of memory and time that can be tightened recursively on stack.

[a b c] means (infcur a b c). Infcur takes infinity params aka never evals, so its a kind of list.

/*
Designing these ops: opStream streamGet streamPut (and possibly a separate opLambda if cant merge it with stream op efficiently).
Start by defining some designVars, such as areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged.

areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged - If true, opLambda is a way of using opStream. If false, opLambda takes an opStream as one of its params and forkAppends it as new params come in, that opLambda has a list of param names to forkPop from. If true, then streamGet and streamPut are simpler and maybe faster, cuz they just use opStream like a linkedlist of key_and_val and (depending on the design I choose) in some cases u may be in that list and is ignored by streamGet and only slightly interacted with by streamPut. I strongly prefer this be true but its hard to make it efficient.

whatAreTheKeysOfTheFewConstants - (only if areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged). such as p for nextParam, b for funcBody, q for popParams, like (streamGet p) means (streamGet 'p'), and p means 'p' cuz lowercase, and names that start with capital letter are #Names. Or maybe it should be as small as possible such as u and (u u) etc. If false, then there are no such standard constants used in opStream. This and areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged will probably be true. Also, this might be merged all into 1 key as in isThereOnly1ConstantKeyThatTheFewConstantKeysAreMergedInto.

doesOpstreamHaveFuncbodyKey - (only if areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged). This is probably going to be true if areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged, since the alternative is to make streamGet and streamPut check for some structure other than the normal key/vals that opStream is made of.

doesOpstreamHaveNextparamKey - (only if areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged). If true, then funcBody val reads ?nextParam (but something smaller as in whatAreTheKeysOfTheFewConstants) to get the param that just came in to the opStream (such as when u is the second last param, and when u is the last param its waiting for such a param then puts it before the u).

doesOpstreamHavePopparamsKey - (only if areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged). If true, the funcBody val does not have turingComplete control of the vararg while there are still params in the Popparams val, but after that runs out (putting in key/vals), the funcBody val could (if I choose a flexible enuf design) forkEdit the streamOp in turingComplete ways such as to remove all keys matching a certain pattern or to return a completely different thing than a streamOp or to put more params in popparamsKey such as just 1 more param so funcBody val runs each next param or waits for n more params etc. If false, then either NOT areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged OR funcBody val must contain the param names to put in, as it handles its own currying before it has enuf params, which would make it more complex and maybe slower.

howManyCurriesDoesOpstreamWaitOn - max curries anything can wait on is 254 (since 255 means never evals, like in infcur). But in some designs (that I will probably do one or some of) it always waits on only 1 more curry and forkEdits itself or verifies it is halted, such as by evaling (using b/funcbody val) when second last param is u, and not allowing third last or earlier params (except the first 7 params before opcode is known) to be u except if its the last param (or if its second last then that evals). For example, it could be waiting on 300 params (which is more than 254), each with a name, by that being in some kind of list (infcur?) in q/popParams val.

isThereOnly1ConstantKeyThatTheFewConstantKeysAreMergedInto - If true then whatAreTheKeysOfTheFewConstants has only 1 built in key. If there were going to be 3 built in keys, for example, of p/nextParam, q/popParams, and b/funcBody (or whatever those keys are), then that would be put in some datastruct in the val of the one built in key (which may be u as in (streamGet u) or may be _ or empty string or something). This would slow down evaling funcBody but would not slow down other uses of opStream such as opmut-style for if/else * + etc and would make those simpler cuz of simpler streamGet and streamPut. The p/nextParam would only be set if second last param is u (or however thats marked, such as maybe second last param's key is u). If true then, in some possible designs, in (opStream [keyA valA] [keyB valB] [u Stuff]), Stuff would be such a datastruct, maybe an infcur of 3 things, or maybe another opStream with 3 keys but it just doesnt eval cuz is just a few key/vals none of which are the built in constants (or just 1 constant if its merged as in isThereOnly1ConstantKeyThatTheFewConstantKeysAreMergedInto).

howIsOpstreamMarkedToEvalWhenGets1MoreParam - The simplest way is it evals when the second last param is u. Another way is to eval when the second last param is a key/val whose key is u, such as (opStream [keyA valA] [keyB valB] [u Stuff]) is waiting on 1 more param, and (opStream [keyA valA] [keyB valB] [u Stuff] x) would forkEdit Stuff to say nextParam is x, andOr maybe append a key/val of [someParamNameFromThePopparamsList x], then get FuncBody out of Stuff and call it on all that together.

whatsTheKeyValDatastructThatOpstreamIsAListOf - Since (infcur key val) is written as [key val] in the default syntax, infcur seems the most intuitive. Else it would be an op I design just for that such as (opKeyVal key val), just a semantic to mean its a key and val, and maybe it would allow 1 more param such as (opKeyVal whatKindOfOpstreamListItemIsThis key val) and whatKindOfOpstreamListItemIsThis might tell if its a "built in" whatAreTheKeysOfTheFewConstants kind of thing or a normal key/val. Probably I'll just use [key val].

howIsEmptyOpstreamDetected - Op is known at 7 params (of u), and after that o8/opcode is copied from left child. An optimization can be to define an op at param 6 and just let the 7th param be its first param, and if that 7th param is u vs anything_except_u thats 2 kinds of the op (that both do the same thing), but when using that optimization it must always be halted at its first (7th of u) param since thats required in the first 7 params of u. Similarly I was considering opOneMoreParam (which isnt going to be any op anymore since opLambda is merging into opStream) was going to be known at 5 params of u and have its next 2 params that way, so that the number of params the lambda is waiting on is known at 7 params as it would have been a vararg (up to around 240-something max params) thats measured at that 7th param. I might just put a mask bit in to say it has more than 7 params or not or that it has exactly 7 params, or count the number of params up to 14 and 15 means more than that but i'd have to find room for those 4 bits if so. Probably best to just check l.l.o8 or something like that.


Maybe streamGet and streamPut should have a fast way to check for a (opLambda ...) vs [[keyA valA] [keyB valB] [keyA anotherVal]], and for streamGet to find the [[keyA valA]...] in the opLambda and recurse into that. But what about streamPut on opLambda, is that even allowed?
(opLambda FuncBody [z y x varNameABC] [[keyA valA]...])
(opLambda FuncBody cBody [z y x varNameABC] [[keyA valA]...] NextParam) -> (opLambda FuncBody [z y x] [[keyA valA]... [varNameABC NextParam]]).
(opLambda FuncBody [z] [[keyA valA]... [varNameABC NextParam] [x valX] [y valY]]) is halted,
but (opLambda FuncBody [] [[keyA valA]... [varNameABC NextParam] [x valX] [y valY] [z valZ]]) is not halted so cant be the datastruct that funcBody is called on.
It also causes a problem of how does opLambda get a copy of itself to call itself recursively.
If its like the old versions of this system, it would be (FuncBody [(opLambda ...allParamsExceptLast...) lastParam]),
so just calling l then r on the param of FuncBody would get (opLambda ...allParamsExceptLast...) which includes FuncBody.
It could just make up more param names such as call (opLambda FuncBody [z y x varNameABC]) on whatever [[keyA valA]...] it got,
[but that would tend to make [[keyA valA]...] get ever bigger (unless streamPack it, which can be slow so shouldnt use every recursion).
It could forkPop the top n key/vals from [[keyA valA]...] and put them back into [z y x varNameABC] but they are not necessarily in the same order and not necessarily only occur once each since the same could have been written multiple times, if it was made by something other than that opLambda called on stuff (something could have forkEdited the contents of the opLambda).
Maybe the [z y x varNameABC] should be another [[keyA valA]...] in reverse order that can just pop from one and push on the other, replacing vals in some cases (else might view it as a default val)?

isThereOpOneMoreParam - ???

howDoesAFnCallItselfRecursively - ??? The FuncBody must take just 1 param so {...} can define it easily, and whatever opLambda andOr opStream does is how thats used as more params. Theres a few ways I'm considering: opOneMoreParam, (opLambda FuncBody [z y x varNameABC] [[keyA valA]...]), and doesOpstreamHaveFuncbodyKey_or_etc. opOneMoreParam complicates streamGet and streamPut but makes it easy to copy Node.evaler from left child. (opLambda [...param names...] ...those param values...) being a completely separate structure as opStream (which would then just be an infcur/[...]) ??? Maybe streamGet and lambdaGet should be different ops, and have different prefix such as ?x and $x ? Theres no lambdaPut. Maybe also some prefix for streamPut. If its done that way, thats areOplambdaAndOpstreamMerged being false. lambdas and streams must be able to interact with eachother. I could make a lambdaOrStreamGet op, thats less efficient cuz it checks for 2 different o8s. I could make (λ x (λ y (...))), and it could be written as λxλy(...), which would basically be opOneMoreParam written as λ.


(opLambda FuncBody [] [z y x varNameABC])
(opLambda FuncBody [] [z y x varNameABC] valABC) -> (opLambda FuncBody [varNameABC valABC] [z y x]).
opStream would just be infcur as [keyA valA keyB valB ...], and one of those is in opLambda.

Seems like too much stuff to compute efficiently, including copying of Node.evaler, not just "from l child" but in this structure.
But it has the big advantage of it has unlimited vararg and funcBody is always within constant depth of the end, and you only need the o8/opcodeByte to know it is this kind of thing.

Ok, so game state as lambdas is basically a simple subset of sexpr defining a map,
and real lambdas are allowed in it, not just strings and infcurs and doubles and doublearrays etc.
For example, you could put an AI algorithm as a key or part of a key or value or part of a value.
Keys have to be perfectDeduped. Vals have to be perfectDeduped unless they are a rawCbt which is viewed as a double array.
Thats cuz vm.Mut.dedupedFn and vm.Mut.valMut must be perfectDeduped.
That doesnt mean you need an id256 for those perfectDeduped. Thats one way to do it,
but it can be just any fn that doesnt contain any blob is automatically perfect deduped already.

Syntax:
(x y z) is calling x on y, and what that returns calling that on z, aka ((x y) z).
{x y z} is {{x y} z} aka (s (s x y) z).
[x y z] is (infcur x y z).
,x is (t x)
<...> is a syntax of lambdas that eval during opmut, like abc.def<abc.hello.xyz>.mm is similar to abc.def[abc.hello.xyz].mm in js code, but theres details to work out. Use abc<<def>> vs abc<def> or some syntax inside <>, if need more kinds of syntax.
(...)#aName or {...}#aName or [...]#aName defines that aName refers to the same constant if aName is written anywhere else in that same local namespace, but it doesnt affect any kind of ids cuz ids only refer to forest shape and in some cases different duplicates of the same forest shape.
TODO syntax for small string literals with no whitespace, vs #names of constants, and is it utf8 or utf16. For example, maybe NamesThatStartWithCapitalLetter are #Constants and namesThatDont are literals, and if you want 'NamesThatStartWithCapitalLetter' as a literal, or 'NamesThatStartWithCapitalLetter with whitespace', then quote it. ?x would be a lambda param, as the lambda op will take up to around 250 params (or is it up to around 125?) that are named, or maybe in an infcur list of them, and maybe (lambda [?x ?y ?varABC] {funcBody that uses x? y? ?varABC} ...params...). Remember that calls (funcBody (lazyEval (lambda [?x ?y ?varABC] {funcBody that uses x? y? ?varABC} ...paramsExceptLast...) lastParam)) when it gets enuf params, and (x? (lazyEval (lambda [?x ?y ?varABC] {funcBody that uses x? y? ?varABC} ...paramsExceptLast...) lastParam)) returns whatever nth param the order of ?x is in that.

---------


vm.Mut is normally only used in a fraction of a second to transform a lambda to another lambda, as a mutable optimization.
As a lambda, it would maybe be 2 maps, of fn to fn, and of fn to cbtAsDoubleArray or as (typeval "double[]" bitstring) or (typeval "int[]" bitstring) etc.
The fns that are keys and vals in that map, other than the double[] int[] etc, would be deduped
(but doesnt necessarily require hashing them, since they could just be deduped by id64 if they dont wrap any blobs).
How would I use that to make a worldofgoo-like node (circle with poles between some of them sparsely), or musical instrument parts like in puredata?
I could use (infcur "x")#fieldX as "the x field", and (infcur "gameObject443")#gob443, and map (gob443 fieldX) to 29.3 [(typeval "double" cbtWithThoseBitsOf_29.3) maybe].
Or simpler, (gob443 fieldX 29.3) as a call of infcur (thats of course instantly halted). It could also have (gob443 fieldX 11) but it could be used like
only 1 of those should occur in any one "state" (in immutable/stateless lambdas) even though it could technically occur.
Maybe view it like a "file system" "/gob443/fieldX -> 29.3". but has to be lambdas somehow.
However its organized, it seems that translating between the 2 data formats, of lambda and mutspace, is going to be some kind of map of lambda to lambda.
Deduped lambda has 64 bit local id, and any nondeduped cbt thats at the top of its blob wrapper, can just imply its blobFrom is 0 and blobTo is that blob size,
so both of these together, mapping dedupedLambda to [dedupedLambda or topmostInItsBlobNondedupedCbt], fits in 128 bits,
and a double could also fit in 64 bits if we only use idA_concat_idB in the nonnormedNaNs (so around 2^52 of them) as id64s and those that are normed doubles are those doubles.
User level code (in opmut or interpreted lambdas) is not allowed to know which 64 bits (2*64=128) that is since it would make VM behaviors nonstandard (reference, not pointer),
but can check them for equality and call them as lambda (after dedup if not already deduped, which vals may not be).
So can put those in a hashtable (maybe just pairs of lambda and lambdaOrDouble) or simpler a list or tree sorted by such id64s.
User level code wouldnt get to know the order of them in that datastruct, so I'm not sure how to make that a lambda.
User level code can sort lambdas by any chosen comparator, as long as the last comparator guarantees to give an order to everything that doesnt equal,
such as the comparator of first sort by height then to break ties sort recursively by left child then to break ties sort recursively by right child.
I might be making this harder than it is. Basically its just a bunch of pairs of lambda as key and lambda as value, in lambda form, and Mut objects during opmut,
and a pair of lambda as key and lambda as value is a simple well defined lambda, but "a bunch of" is the hard part. It has to be 1 lambda.
I could use an infcur alternating key val key val, and if I wanted to translate it to a more efficient datastruct (such as a treemap) just loop over it doing that,
or infcur of (pair key val) or something like that. Maybe have an op just for this semantic: (keyval key val)
as in (infcur (keyval key val) (keyval key val) (keyval key val) (keyval key val) (keyval key val) ...) would be the lambda state,
and a bunch of Muts, whose .dedupedFn is key, and whose valMut, valDouble, andOr valDoubles are the val (might need 2 or 3 vals like a keyValfnValdoubleValdoublesValints op or something?).

//primaryKey is <int_or_maybe_double whichOpmutSpace, fn dedupedFn>. primaryKey of a dedupedFn is 64 bits. primaryKey of a non-deduped-fn is 128 bits.

TODO merge the opmut state space with the lambda state(less) space, maybe by adding a fifth int to the 4 ints of key of (localname of) lambdas (whichOpmutSpace idA idB blobFrom blobTo). In a deduped lambda, blobFrom and blobTo are both 0. Or maybe that fifth/whichOpmutSpace int is 1 of the 4 salt ints (salt128 in StackStuff)?
,,
Instead of merging with FuncallCache, make FuncState parallel to FuncallCache, and key is FuncState<int,fn> which is a js object that has 1 mutable ptr to fn and 1 mutable ptr to Float64Array and maybe 1 mutable double. The int in <int,fn> is whichOpmutSpace.
..
FuncState<int,fn> will mostly be for fns that are made only of combos of infcur but can in general be any fn as long as its perfectDeduped (which can be done by int for short times).









/*
Consider cp(Mut,Mut)->Mut (and maybe with a whichOpmutSpace) as a third part of cp, just a number so they dont overlap mutable values,
and the ints are used the same way for hashing to dedup Muts. Or could use fns as muts but only the subset of fns that are made completely of infcurs,
and key of a Mut would be that fn, but that would be expensive cuz of the other fields fns have, so just do ints Muts.
vm.Mut = function(whichOpmutSpace,leftMut,rightMut){
	this.whichOpmutSpace = whichOpmutSpace;
	this.id; //int id/bucket, without deletions, so once its created it stays there until the whole hashtable is garbcoled.
	this.valMut; //mutable pointer at a Mut. unlike the 2 immutable perfect deduped pointers at its left and right childs (not stored, since you only look up by those).
	this.valFn = u;
	this.valNum = 0;
	this.valNums = emptyDoubleArray;
};
vm.Mut.prototype.p(mut){ return mutCp(whichOpmutSpace,this,mut); } //cp(Mut,Mut)
This would be slower for some things than just using OpmutState.ints[ptr to ptr+7] and having separate fn and optional Float64Array for each,
but its easier to use.

This removes the need for Mut.m (js map of string to MutOrDouble) and for strings. Consider that binforest shape is superexponential.



















Consider making a variant of opmut, to be used with the existing kind of opmut, thats specialized in lower level primitive ops, especially ints (and maybe doubles etc), and is more like acyclicFlow and especially the form of it that reads from 2 indexs and writes to 1, all 3 being chosen by the 32 bit opcode, instead of the write to address being derived from it being the nth opcode in the sequence. If could call that, in a flexible way, from opmut, then it would be like 3 levels of slow/flexible .. midSpeed/midFlexible/opmut .. fast/inflexible/lowLevel/<this new op>.
DO IT.
And "eat my own dogfood", use it to derive the 32 bit voxel graphics, and generate int[1024x1024] from it 60 times per second.
Optimize as far as it takes. Put it on screen and play with it.




?????
Consider putting .i field (for Int32Array) instead of just .d (Float64Array), in Mut, so can do graphics ints faster, considering CPU cache of few levels. Size matters.


??? use the following in opmut, and store graphics in Float64Array(512*512).buffer which is just 2mB for 1 megapixel. This can be translated to/from the "32 bit voxels" mentioned below, which could be a detail of one of many possible ways to generate the double[1<<18] graphics.
...
"eat your own dogfood". use opmut, and not extra code in VM, to do whatever voxel system want to implement. take just a cbt for pixels 60+ times per second (and similar but utc time needed for sound)...
Since opmut normally uses Float64Array and {}jsmaps (in compiled form), consider a double/float64 being a 2x2x3x4 grid of bits aka a 2x2 grid of 12bitcolor pixels. double has 53 bits of integer precision. thats only 48. and it can do 1024x1024x12bitcolor in a double[512*512], which can be copied 4 times faster if its aligned on 512x512.


















If using opmut to derive graphics lambdas that return whole Byterect blob all at once, requires using lower resolution such as 512x512 or 256x256 etc (no lower than old game consoles graphics), then maybe thats an ok way to start, considering that so far it doesnt do any graphics at all, and that would at least be a way to build fun things quickly. Or maybe the opmut optimizations will be (using cpu) fast enough that it can do higher resolution. (not to mention GPU, which I'll do later, but it has sequential limits such as .001 to .01 seconds per GPU call (and sometimes 20 gpu calls in 1 in opencl, can be nearly as fast, but gpujs I'm not sure if their combineKernels works as well).... get cpu doing fun things first.


If it doesnt slow down too much to generate a whole other megapixel blob each video frame, then maybe should just do graphics as generate such a 4mB blob (ARGB 32 bit pixels),
and whatever way of doing that in middle steps, is ok, such as y10x10rgb12 voxels. also consider that Float64Array would be used in opmut (so 8mB) to make the 4mB blob.
make drag and droppable sound/graphics/game/gamepad/quickload/quicksave/etc windows, and make simple games in them. todo.















More generally (than next "xel32 graphics of 512x1024 resolution" paragraph below),
use infcur (or some op) as streaming sequence of graphicsOp, where a graphicsOp is (maybe a mutop or maybe something lambda/immutable)
... is a transform of int[1<<20] to int[1<<20] (as in a ByteRect of 1024x1024 pixels), but 12 bit color optimization in some parts at least.
A kind of graphicsOp is to offset x and y by such a 32 bit voxel (using just 10 bits of y and 10 bits of x for example, but faster just add it as int),
so offset in x and y.
A kind of graphicsOp is a list of 32 bit voxels to paint y10 x10 rgb10.
A kind of graphicsOp is 2 graphicsOps, one to do first, one to do after that (in case of overlap order matters).
There could be other graphicsOps, but consider the benefits of doing as lambdas so those who havent opted in to organizing things that way
will still understand it through the common math of "what does a lambda call return".
If it doesnt slow down too much to generate a whole other megapixel blob each video frame, then maybe should just do graphics as generate such a 4mB blob (ARGB 32 bit pixels),
and whatever way of doing that in middle steps, is ok, such as y10x10rgb12 voxels. also consider that Float64Array would be used in opmut (so 8mB) to make the 4mB blob.












Do this for voxel32 graphics of 512x1024 resolution 12 bit color, infcur-like int[] streaming ignoring internal tree structure...
int[] as infcurAt6Params, only the order of ints matters, for y512_x1024_rgb12Bits voxels, where first bit chooses between add to current 19 bit xy offset vs be a leaf 31 bit voxel. So make an int[] (such as 5 or 2054634 ints) and prefix it with +offset and suffix it with -offset, and use infcur to define such a streaming int[] regardless of internal tree structure of infcurs.
???
TODO make new op, similar to infcurAt6Params, thats ONLY for stream appending int[], and infloops if anything else is put in it. and use 1 of the mask bits (have 2 reserved for future expansion, so 1 left) for that??? no dont need a mask bit, cuz by inflooping if its NOT that recursively, just its existence implies that.

/*TODO make infcur be known at param 6 so theres 2 ops for it, so theres an o8 that can detect if its at the end of an infcur efficiently.
	and use it for 32 bit y10x10rgb12 voxels with 32 bit offset (anded into 1<<20 array of ints 4 times more bytes in ByteRect) used in canvas.

instead do...
infcur (known at 6 params, and next param may be int offset)....
(infcurAt6Params intOffsetA (infcurAt6Params intOffsetB ints ints ints (infcurAt6Params intOffsetC ints) ... ...
but i'd prefer intOffset be parsable in the order it occurs from the top of a fn (binary forest node aka lambda) down, instead of so deep you have to find the infcur first.
(someDerivedSymbolMeaningOffset intOffset thing)
(someDerivedSymbolMeaningPairOfVoxel32GraphicsNodes graphicsNodeA graphicsNodeB) //similar to pair
where graphicsNode* may be either of those 2 kind of things OR an int[] (as cbt).
..
If it was an append-only-intarray, maybe this datastruct, starting at a given int ptr: *ptr is local size of this node in units of ints. Downward, it has these: addToValuesOfChildA ptrToChildA addToValuesOfChildB ptrToChildB <*ptr-5 (or is it -4?) number of literal voxel32s>. At ptr==4 (+1 -1 etc? is that right number?) is an "empty node" of no childs and no voxels. The first 4 ints in the "append-only-intarray: are: 0 4 0 4 5, aka offset childPtr offset childPtr sizeOfThisNode, and childPtr is pointing at itself, as the basecase. Its basically the NullObject.
That defines a stream-appendable image format, but I'll probably use lambdas/fns forest with int[]s in it, instead of purely appendable blob.
The main advantage of this image format is it can share branches, reuse multiple existing sets of voxels at x y offsets (but not scaling or rotating) to define another such set, without storing the duplicates that are just recursive offsets. For example, to have a 12x12 pixel set of 144 int voxels for a certain char of a certain font and for many of them to occur various places. the ints could be derived at runtime for advanced graphics, but the ability to make a literal copy at a 2d offset would save alot of compute power.
..
as lambda....
(someSymbol int[]LiteralVoxels childAOffsetInt childAOrU childBOffsetInt childBOrU), where childA and childB are similar someSymbol calls, and "orU" means u is viewed like null.
...
consider stream appendable int[] as infcurAt6Params, only the order of ints matters, for y512_x1024_rgb12Bits voxels, where first bit chooses between add to current 19 bit xy offset vs be a leaf 31 bit voxel. So make an int[] (such as 5 or 2054634 ints) and prefix it with +offset and suffix it with -offset, and use infcur to define such a streaming int[] regardless of internal tree structure of infcurs.
???
TODO make new op, similar to infcurAt6Params, thats ONLY for stream appending int[], and infloops if anything else is put in it. and use 1 of the mask bits (have 2 reserved for future expansion, so 1 left) for that??? no dont need a mask bit, cuz by inflooping if its NOT that recursively, just its existence implies that.

/*TODO asap make the lambdas of variable number of (lambda funcBody ?varA ?varb ?varc u ...paramsOfThatManyParamsUpTo240Something), AND make the Mut as described below, and do some basics graphics, sound, or something just start playing with it.



FIXED design keeps Mut mostly as it is, adds .j->fn and .g->string and has weaker merged gasTime/gasMem and only runs for a tiny fraction of a second so it wont run out of mem.
"Mut.m -> {} where key is string and val is [Mut or double or undefined], with null prototype?." prevents accidentally getting string when you expected double.
..
TODO asap, but confirm this solves the problem...
Have ops for string length, concat, substring, etc.
Have try/catch op for undefined[anything] where some things may return undefined.
Have just 1 var in opmut that counts down with each thing done next, sometimes counts by variable amount like when string concat it will check their lengths.
I'm guessing (TODO verify) that putting a big string as a map key doesnt cost the size of that string as its deduped or hashed or something... but im not sure.
Opmut only happens, normally, for a small fraction of a second. Its unlikely to run out of memory at all.
So if just use 1 gas* var, gasTimeAndOrMem, and subtract from it for heap allocation and for every write in a {}, then it cant infinite loop and must halt within some approximatable (though might vary by 10 times faster or slower) limit.

OLD, cuz DO ALLOW CONCAT ETC DYNAMIC STUFF...
Optimize Mut by not (UPDATE yes) allowing direct access to strings, except as symbols, keys in Mut.m. No concat. No length. No listing them.
If you ask for one that doesnt exist, it gives undefined.
so its like the structs mentioned below except theres only 1 type and it has int keys of doubles and string keys of double_or_mut_or_undefined. mut also has 1 lambda/fn field thats often not deduped.
but how to limit mem use in {}?
????
+ of string vs double, and in {} keys, seems hard to limit the memory of, since + can cause string concat or expand mem of {}.
but without strings as {} keys (or maybe some kind of number), browser js wont optimize it well.
If could just limit memory recursively on stack, of strings, then Mut as usual would work.
???
What if Mut.m[anyKey] -> always a mut OR double, but never a string or fn cuz if so those would go in field of Mut?
Mut.n size of Float64Array if need to have null prototype.
Mut.m -> {} where key is string and val is [Mut or double or undefined]. (with null prototype?).
Mut.d -> Float64Array (with null prototype)?.
Mut.g -> string
Mut.j -> fn (u by default).
..
Can aMut.m.someStringABC cuz know 'someStringABC' is a string (dont need to wrap in a Mut in Mut.g),
but otherwise the only keys accepted in it are from Mut.g.
..
I think I fixed it, TODO verify.
Still need to track memory in Mut.m since dont know if it has a key or not, but if check if it has such a key that might make it too slow??? Basically just need to know the {} size of Mut.m. Its too slow to make Mut.prototype.putM(key,val) func, that would count it, since it needs to use loop optimizations that already exist in browser js VMs.
Mostly this 1 thing left... Count the number of key/val pairs in Mut.m... But how???
How??
..
Opmut only happens, normally, for a small fraction of a second. Its unlikely to run out of memory at all.

------old comments...


opmut struct optimization...
Root types: emptyType, lambdaWrapperType, doubleType (and maybe other primitive types).
There are 4 kinds of derived types:
-- placeholder for the type the placeholder is a direct child of, which is replaced by hashname of its parent after hashing,
	and if hashing again, is replaced by the one "placeholder constant" then hash again which generates the same hash,
	so it can do trees where parent is same type as any constant n of its childs (FIXME what if (int,thatPlaceholder)?).
-- (int,type)->that many of type, basically an array of ptrs, though i'm unsure if some things will be inlined (especially doubleType will be inlined in Float64Array).
-- (nameA,typeA,nameB,typeB,nameC,typeC... for any number of name/type pairs.
..
TODO build this asap in opmut wikibinator203 opcode.
(((TODO after that build a different opcode for GPUjs-like/lazycl-like calculations since they cant handle dynamic memory efficiently, though gpujs does it more than opencl (which lazy uses) cuz gpujs is built on webgl which has pointers into "opengl textures" etc. They're both similar enough that they would be optimizations of the same wikibinator203 opcode.
)))
For example, if you want a loop for(let j=0; j<... then j would be the name of a double or int in a struct and is a mutable double or int etc.
Maybe similar for "a line of code" that does a few * + - Math.sin, pointer jumping of specific type.fieldname etc.
..
FIXME want ability to copy between var size double[] and fn/cbt, without having to use a different type per size.
What if a "(int,type)->that many of type" defines a minimum number of those instead of a specific number? But how does that help in copying the whole thing? It would be better to just be variable size of it, but once an instance is created its that constant size, which can differ from other instances of same type*nNumberOfThem.
..
Throwing together various puredatalike musical instrument parts, those parts could have a certain type in common that has n input doubles m output doubles etc... BUT how could the parent opmut call (which has a struct type) get a ptr to those if they're INSIDE different types than that? it seems to need inheritance, but that could slow things. Find an efficient solution...





for optimized cpu evalers in opmut (lambdas other than opmut can still do what they normally do)...
Consider using struct-like inheritance-like stuff, where every fieldName has a class so classABC.fieldXYZ is a different int than classDEF.fieldXYZ int. To read the field at a class* just add the int to it. can be ptr or double. not sure where the doubles go.
a class is a merkle-like linkedlist of triples of class, name, and val. if classABC has 20 fields, then there are 21 classes in its inheritance chain. its superclass has 19 fields, and so on to the root class which has 0 fields. a subclass instance of a field type can be pointed at by that field. but where do the doubles go? but wouldnt this slow things down by instanceof in deep inheritance andOr casting?
What if theres no inheritance and theres just final structs as classlike things, where each of n fields in a struct type is a struct which may be a different struct or its own type. and put the doubles in there.
Could name struct types by hash of their definition, and after hashing, any part of their definition that means "self type" is replaced by that hash.
double could be such a type. (and Float64Array (size(s)?) somehow typelike or related how????)???.
Wrapper of fn is also such a type.
i dont want to limit it to such simple datastructs, with no dynamic lookup of string keys, no inheritance, etc, but its hard to optimize things in opmut.
This seems very optimizable in (opmut [...tree of code...] mut),
BUT is it flexible enough?


Try to do the whole cpu optimized opmut (not the gpu optimized kind) in 1 big Float64Array of powOf2 size where doubles are used as both pointers (mask them) so can use them both as doubles and as objects. Use doubles in some cases as [viewed as up to 11 base26 chars such as 'helloworldx' or 'i'] and use a simple linkedlist (may be bringToFrontList?) for key/value maps of SMALL NUMBERS OF KEY/VALS PER OBJECT. It will implement map of map to map where each map is a double value, including that each double maps to a fn |} u.

Consider using datastruct of [leftPtr rightPtr Float64Array], and the 2 ptrs and contents of the array are mutable, and to implement abc.def.ghi = abc.xyz+2 etc, could make small such maps in the left/right cons-like shape. each such node would have a toString that returns a certain double, and double could be viewed as up to 11 base26 chars such as 'helloworldx' or 'i'. Basically you use it as a list of key/val pairs that are each doubles. and could use bringtofrontlist in some cases.
???
could it be fast enough?



TODO replace Mut with prototypeless Float64Array and prototypeless {},
with instance var of toString, and only use keys of double or undefined,
and toString returns a double.
put fns in an Array() used as a map of double to fn, allowing duplicate fns so lazyDedup doesnt cause nondeterminism.
Check vm.gas* during this.
Use doubles as base26 number of at most 11 digits, for human readable names, at least in some range of doubles.
so basically its a map of map to map where each map appears as a double and can have a pointer to a fn, and some such maps only allow a subset of doubles, while others are slower and allow all possible doubles.

Syntax change: [a b c] means (infcur a b c). Replace a[b] with a<<b>> aka mutA.m[b]. a<b> still means mutA.d[b].
() still means currylist. {} still means sCurryList.
opmut mutable (temporarily during an immutable call as optimization) vars start with . like .abc.def means rootMut.m.abc.m.def .
opmut only uses [], such as (opmut [while [lt .i .j] [...loopBody...]] someParam). while and lt would be 2 #names of lambdas. while is opcode. lt doesnt have to be, but could be any lambda that takes 2 doubles and returns a double, or something like that. or maybe has to be opcode at least in early versions its easier to optimize.
It can call opmut recursively, with (opmut [...]) having a cached mutEvaler and taking a param of Mut, string, double, fn, or undefined.
Careful to verify something is a string vs double, such as by multiplying by 1 before doing double ops, so vm.stackMem counts the allocation of strings such as by + concat. '55'*1+1 is 56 in js, so thats a problem. might have to use .length to check the difference, or typeof would probably be slower. Or wrap in Number(55)+1. This could be a problem for optimizing?
..
Or maybe just write it like rootMut.m.abc.m.def and allow rootMut.m<'abc'>.m.def.d<42> etc.

I was planning to just use js + and not worry about if its string vs number, just let it do the same thing it does in js,
but the problem is need to count the memory if it creates a string.

Its the same speed as you see here:
..

TODO I might want more than 4 kinds of paired chars () {} [] <>, but thats all there is on common keyboards.
Consider using just () and prefixing it with a letter so theres 26 kinds: a(...) to z(...).
Problem is, in things like rootMut.m<'abc'>.m.def.d<42> or abc[def].ghi<abc<44>>, the syntax doesnt have a plce to put a char before the (...) without it appearing strange, like instead of abc[def], abcm(def) which is 2 things: abc and m(...). maybe abc.m(def) ?
Or, keep 2 of those char pairs, such as [] and <>, for that syntax, and keep {} for sCurryList, and have up to 26 (or 23? so alloc a letter for those other kinds too?) kinds of a(...) to z(...).
...
{...}
[...]
a(...) to z(...)
<...>
abc.m(...).d(...)
s(...)
t(...) is like s except its what st does in earlier versions, its s with t of the first thing in the (...). ??? or use t(...) for something else?
.abc the . prefix means rootMut.abc. Like in i(< .a .b).
Maybe should use a[...] to z[...] so you dont have to push shift to get to ( ) so often.
,x means c(t x), and by c(...) i mean normal currylist but might change the letter to something other than c.
...
can .abc.def[abc.ghi]<(+ 2 3)> be written a simpler way?
...
Should every char define a syntax of what follows, like n5.3 is the number 5.3 cuz it starts with n, and ghello is the string 'hello' cuz it starts with g?
Maybe, but how would the end be detected? Theres only 4 char pairs  (){}[]<> that auto end eachother, and only (){}[] 3 pairs of them are recognized in common texteditors.
..
Let use p[a b c] to mean curryList(infcur a b c), since p[] are 3 adjacent chars on keyboard so is fast to type.
..
..
In forest, abc.def means p[...something involving gabc and gdef except it calls to get rootMut.m.def...]
..
Could I get rid of Mut and just use Float64Array, {}, string, double, fn, and undefined directly? In Float64Array and {} can set prototype to null. but in string, double, and fn, need to know the type, or do something to make sure to generate code that returns the expected type...
..
(anything-0) is always a number.
String(anything) is always a string, or throws.
Whether something is a Float64Array or {}, with null prototype, those are both kinds of mutable map. How to check if it is? typeof, etc... are probably too slow.
I could put fn in some kind of wrapper with no prototype.
Some stuff to figure out still...
...
Consider adding a fn/lambda field to Mut, in j (field name for example), and only have lambda inside Mut when in opmut.
vm.Mut = function(n,optionalLambda){
	this.n = n&0x7fffffff;
	this.d = new Float64Array(this.n);
	this.m = {};
	this.j = optionalLambda || u;
	Object.setPrototypeOf(this.d,null);
	Object.setPrototypeOf(this.m,null);
};
That way, everything in opmut is 1 of: mut, string, number, undefined.
Could webasm optimize this better? Its got strongly typed stuff.
Theres a WebAssembly var in some browsers.



In Mut I dont need map of string to thing. I just need at most pow(2,30) symbols, and can load them from strings such as "varXYZ" might become symbol 600111234. As long as the doubles in Float64Array have index less than the other symbols its ok. I dont need string concat string. i dont need strings at all. can just put stringlike data in the Float64Array if i want to do that kind of thing.
Mut = function(sym, n, optionalLambda){
	this.sym = sym; //int
	this.n = n;
	this.d = new Float64Array(n);
	this.j = optionalLambda || u;
	this.m = {}; //map of sym to thing. thing is any of Mut, double, undefined.
	//Maybe... this.e is 1 double, like this.d[0] except in a var by itself???
	remove prototypes of this.d and this.m;
	could make Mut.prototype.toString return sym which is a double/int, so when used in {} it acts as sym.
	could have an array somewhere of [sym]->Mut.
	This seems it would fix the + optimization problem, since there are no strings.
};
Think of it like nodes that each have 2 outgoing edges, and each chooses which such edge based on a shared boolean var that if/else while for etc changes. those 2 edges often go the same place if it doesnt branch, is just the next thing to do. Each next "thing to do" is to read 3 things, and write, like []= or <>=, in recursive namespace of syms. a sym is an int (with mappings to human readable names, but the mut vm doesnt use those names often). you could have i=0; i.hello=j[abc.def[ghi<i>]] or soemthing like that.
..
getting rid of strings is the right thing to do, replace with sym int that maps 1 to 1 with a string outside the Mut system but some opcodes in mut can create more or access it etc.
..
If all doubles are at known places in mut (in .d[index] or maybe .e) then the types are known, so i dont have to deal with js problems of does + mean concat string to double or add 2 doubles or convert '45'+1 to 46, etc.
I'd still need a 2-way forest (in some branches 1-way like negate is unary or a constant is 0-way) of basically get 3 things using 3 exprs, then do a[b]=c, and each of those 3 things may be mut or double.
also what about undefined? like if you try to GET a symbol from a mut.m but its not there? or if you GET from outside the range of .d?
Since fns wont always be deduped (its lazyEval of dedup), they cant have a sym but can be a fn value inside a mut as aMut.j. Deduped fns could have a sym, but its too slow to dedup everything instantly.
..
consider this as implementation of opmut (not the fastest, but its a start)...
..
aMutFn(a_mut_or_double_or_undefined)->another_mut_or_double_or_undefined.
Example: x=>(x.d[600111234]*x.m[243435456].d[3334]), is a js lambda. 600111234 and 243435456 are the sym ints for some human readable name such as 'varXYZ' or 'i', or some may just be numbers.
Example: x=>x.d[600111234].
..
Example: x=>x.d[x.m[243435456]].
..
Can strings be used directly as syms for possibly more efficient code x.m.varXYZ ? Without concat or + on them etc, could avoid overlapping the fields of Mut like Mut.d Mut.m etc???
Problem is {} will convert int to base ten string??? Unless its an Array() which may be optimized for sparse int keys?
..
what if  Mut.toString gives a sym as string that was put in during Mut constructor?
No, toString needs to return a double if the js + optimization is to avoid unexpectedly creating strings.
So aMut.m[anotherMut] would use anotherMut.toString which would give a number.
..
Instead of allocating syms for varnames, maybe just sha256 (or faster hash) the varname to get an int in some high range 2pow30 to 2pow31minus1, and there can be collisions and thats viewed as the same var. its more of a comment on the int. if it will have a collision or not could be scanned for before running things, where it matters. or, could just view 30 bits as up to 6 chars of var name a..z0..5 such as hello or myxyk or i or j. but longer strings are probably needed for ppl to understand it. could have up to 53 bits if its a double, and in that could have up to 11 chars that are made of a-z. such as 'tostring' or 'helloworldx' or 'i' or 'j'. just viewing it as a base26 number. no collisions.
Example: x=>(x.helloworldx*x.jjii[3334]);
toString always returns a double, unless its tostring of undefined.
..
but if muts are {} and Float64Arrays (no prototype, set to null) directly, then how to protect its tostring function?

.a.b [] <> etc are opmut syntax, but are fns. opmut syntax is still fn forest.
?x or maybe _x is var name syntax. can use the same syntax in opLambda defining params and in funcBody to read it,
and somehow in opmut.
I dont plan to optimize opLambda, and instead will just optimize combos of opmut and the call pair forest and some of the {...}/sCurryList.


TODO (opLambda {...funcBody that uses x? z? z? x? y? ...} ?x ?y ?z u valOfX valOfY valOfZ), and start using it asap.
Get rid of vararg opLambda and opOneMoreParam, but keep varargAx and infcur.[[[
The following big quote from other file led to this one line conclusion:
	TODO Something like (opLambda (x z y) (* 2 (+ x y z))) but thats lisp syntax of a similar thing.
	... maybe (opLambda anInfcurOfVarNames) has as many more params (curriesLeft), up to 240something, as params in anInfcurOfVarNames after the infcur???
	... maybe (opLambda {...funcBody that uses x? z? z? x? y? ...} ?x ?y ?z u valOfX valOfY valOfZ). the u (or choose some other constant) marks the end of the params list. it still can only have at most 240something params. ?x is a replacement of opOneMoreParam and is instead something like (opDefineLambdaParamName 'x'), and x? is something like (opGetValueOfLambdaParamName 'x'). In {...} syntax, since theres no strange flipping of left/right order, should work as usual.
	Put a bit in headerInt mask, that tells if it has reached the u param yet, marking that it has as many params as its going to, so even if a further param is ?varNameMNOP, that will be just another param and not defining to look for varNameMNOP?.
	...and TODO make the {...} syntax and opmut etc work with that. Start using it in interpreted mode.
	Only optimize combos of opmut and s/{...}, dont need to optimize opLambda.
..
TODO verify this is done by writing a lambda that does the same as s, but using opLambda of 3 params, and make sure its readable in {...} syntax.
..	
QUOTE:
	maybe (lambdaOrVarargax funcBody uIfIsLambdaElseIsAx)
	or (lambdaOrVarargax funcBody comment)...
	both of those at param7, so all you need to do to find funcBody is check for a certain o8 then get r.
	o8 of (lambdaOrVarargax funcBody).

	what about opOneMoreParam?
	(opOneMoreParam varName aLambda) is param7? or (opOneMoreParam varName aLambda comment) so o8 is simpler? but thats wasteful.
	How to efficiently know when you've reached (opOneMoreParam varName aLambda)? o8 doesnt tell that but an o8 of (opOneMoreParam varName) does. it complicates the loop to find funcBody (in aLambda).

	Maybe should be a bit in headerInt masks that says it is the 7th param? o9 could also do that, but i prefer o8 to fit in a byte.

	(opOneMoreParam varName aLambda x) is always halted since aLambda is waiting for at least 1 more param, so (opOneMoreParam varName aLambda) is waiting for at least 2 more params.
	so could put (opOneMoreParam varName aLambda) at param 6. But would that interfere with u().curriesLeft() is 7, therefore (opOneMoreParam varName aLambda) curriesLeft would be 1 if its at param 6?

	(varargAx funcBodyAndConstraint comment) is at param 7.
	(lambda funcBody comment) is at param 7. //the vararg lambda
	(opOneMoreParam varName aLambda nextParamValueOfVarargLambda) is at param7.

	Also, since max finite curriesLeft is 254, should there be a lambda-like op that takes a byte param to take a byte that becomes curriesLeft? (lambdaByteCurriesleft cbt8 comment) has thatCbt8Of curriesLeft.
	???
	Or could just make 16 ops like in earlier versions of wikibinator, that take 1-16 params.
	The vararg lambda is the main way funcs will be made but might be less efficient in some cases.

	Evaler should be copied, not just from l().evaler but from the aLambda in (opOneMoreParam varName aLambda).

	How to cache the varnames/values in (opOneMoreParam varName) if it gets big?

	Could make an evaler (aLambda ?a ?b ?c) pushEvaler of it, as that takes 3 more params (or is it 4?).
	No problem optimizing that, but (aLambda ?a ?b valOfA valOfB ?c) is harder to optimize.
	Similarly (aLambda ?a valOfA ?b valOfB ?c).
	The ?a ?b ?c are each a (opOneMoreParam somethingLike_"a" aLambda)...
	(opOneMoreParam "c" (opOneMoreParam "b" (opOneMoreParam "a" aLambda) valOfA valOfB)) is a func waiting for val of c and calls funcBody on (lazyeval_or_pair (opOneMoreParam "c" (opOneMoreParam "a" (opOneMoreParam "b" aLambda) valOfA valOfB)) c).
	But its displayed as (aLambda ?a ?b valOfA valOfB ?c).
	..
	FIXME what about {...} syntax of that? How do the 2 syntaxes (of vararg lambdas and sCurryLists) mix?

	(opOneMoreParam "c") should be displayed as ?c.
	(?c (?b (?a aLambda) valOfA valOfB) valOfC)
	If write it that way, {...} syntax is straightforward...
	({,?c {{,?b {,?a getALambda}} getValOfA ,literalValOfB} getValOfC} thing)
	//might have got {{{{}}{{}}... mixed up.
	But its longer than
	(aLambda ?a ?b valOfA valOfB ?c valOfC)

	({,?c {{,?b {,?a getALambda}} gvalOfA gvalOfB} gvalOfC} thing)
	(aLambda ?a ?b lvalOfA lvalOfB ?c lvalOfC)


	This isnt seeming to fit together into an intuitive syntax. It will work technically, but being intuitive is for sure needed for this system to be useful. Simplify...

	What if every lambda has 3 childs instead of 2, and 1 of those childs is the curriesLeft byte? Or linkedlist-like way (more similar to opOneMoreParam)? There would need to be a syntax for it.
	Maybe the char ` (or use ? maybe) means add 1 more param.
	```(aLambda funcBody) means wait for 3 more params, so (```(aLambda funcBody) a b) is halted and (```(aLambda funcBody) a b c) evals. ???
	But I want to write it with ` after the params, so (aLambda funcBody ` ` ` a b) is halted, and  (aLambda funcBody ` ` ` a b c) evals. Similar to (aLambda funcBody ` ` a ` b) is halted and (aLambda funcBody ` ` a ` b c) evals.
	So (aLambda `) means basically (opOneMoreParam aLambda).
	Except, (opOneMoreParam aLambda) wouldnt be halted. It would return a form of aLambda that has curriesLeft 1 higher (and if curriesLeft reaches 255 then its infcur (never evals, stays 255).
	opOneMoreParam and opOneLessParam would both take 1 param and return such a variant of a lambda.
	At each point in the "param list", it can add a param, so it has to remember where it was added. But if it ever gets down to 0 params, it has to eval right then.
	That would maybe need a minCurriesLeft to be stored in headerInt, along with curriesLeft, since for example s takes 3 params but what does it mean if (s a b) is supposed to eval? (opOneLessParam s) would return (s`). Maybe it should ONLY work for the lambda op.
	Also, if you want var names like ?a ?b ?varXYZ to wait for param and a? and b? and ?varXYZ to read param value.... If want that, then would have to use 2 ` and the extra ` is for param name.


	The number of ` displayed (or display as ????) is curriesLeft-minCurriesLeft, or something like that.

	(lambda funcBody) at param 7, has curriesLeft of 1.
	(lambda funcBody ???) at param 7, has curriesLeft of 4. (would prefer it be the same number of ?s but dont know how).
	(lambda varargPlusFuncBody ?? 10 10 5)->25
	(lambda varargPlusFuncBody ? 10 ? 10 5)->25
	(lambda varargPlusFuncBody 12)->12

	(lambda varargPlusFuncBody ?) is a variant of (lambda varargPlusFuncBody).

	opOneLessParam maybe should not be able to reduce curriesLeft below 1 aka should not bea ble to cause an eval.
	opOneMoreParam and opOneLessParam should only work on op lambda. Maybe it should infloop if called on anything else and if try to set curriesLeft to less than 1 or more than 254.

	rename lambda to opLambda, and call lambdas in general fns (functions). fn opLambda.

	? is not a fn. Its a syntax that describes curriesLeft, that can be incremented and decremented by opOneMoreParam and opOneLessParam.



	Maybe vararg, other than in varargAx, costs more than its worth. But I still need a way to make a syntax work where ?abc means waiting on the abc? param to read its value, in an opLambda, while in {...} since most code is in {...} cuz its the simplest way to pass params in turingComplete ways. Also (...)#nameXYZ or {...}#nameXYZ means the localName of that fn/constant is nameXYZ. It has no effect on ids since its not part of the callpair forest.
	({,opLambda {,* ,2 {,varargPlus x? y? z?}}#theFuncBody) ?x ?z ?y 10 30 2)->84 ??? The order of ?x ?y ?z vs ?x ?z ?y is allowed to differ. You can even use x? multiple times such as {,* x? x?}.
	I want the syntax to look something like that, but it seems to need the text to often swap direction of reading "left to right" vs "right to left" and use combos of both of those in the same code string.

	In lisp it would just be written as something like (opLambda (x z y) (* 2 (+ x y z))).

	But I want the ability to put the param definition (?x) in the param list like (something... ?x valOfX ?y valOfY ?z valOfZ)
	or also works as (something... ?x ?y valOfX valOfY ?z valOfZ).

	I dont want to go back to naming params just by their index in the lambda, cuz its confusing to read that code.


	Get rid of vararg opLambda and just define the var names within a constant number of lambda params. and have 240something max params of a lambda. If you want vararg use varargAx, but make sure it returns something other than a partial call of varargAx if you want others across network to accept such a return value since otherwise it might cost them infinite time and memory to disprove a false claim.
	Something like (opLambda (x z y) (* 2 (+ x y z))) but thats lisp syntax of a similar thing.
	..
	Also, I'm not planning to do much optimizing of opLambda, just let it run in interpreted mode, and mostly what will get optimized is opmut and lines of code inside it are small trees of s, and the [] []= <> <>= etc.
	..
	TODO write it with {...}

	({,opLambda {,* ,2 {,varargPlus x? y? z?}}#theFuncBody) ?x ?z ?y 10 30 2)->84 ???
	No, thats still vararg. Move the ?x ?z ?y etc to right after opLambda...

	({,opLambda ,{... use x? y? and z? in here...}#funcBody ,'x' ,'y' ,'z' ,u 10 {,+ get15 ,25} 2} thing)

	or could put all the var names as a string but likely would be slower...
	({,opLambda ,{... use x? y? and z? in here...}#funcBody 'x y z' 10 {,+ get15 ,25} 2} thing)

/*UPDATED comment, maybe need to include in license, about mask_stackIsAllowImportEvilIds (and the opcode for that)...
Maybe it should just be an op to measure if an id has evilBit on or not (its in the first byte of a cbt if used as an id),
since otherwise I'd have to define that any id of a lambda which can import an evil id of a lambda is itself evil,
since it could just flip the bit itself (forkEdit the id bits) then call that,
but it is possible, though may be expensive, to formalVerify a lambda call to not do that, though it couldnt be as flexible of turingComplete if so.
This gets into the problem that evilBit is at least a partial solution to,
that knowing if bits are safe to give execute permission to or not (and this software NEVER gives execute permission to anything,
but opensource forks of it including possible plugins might, so be careful to avoid those possible VMs if you dont know its safe)...
knowing if its safe to give execute permission requires a halting oracle or infinite time and memory or for it to be less than turing complete,
none of which are practical, so this software just doesnt execute. But since many people insist on executing things without checking if they're safe...
Inside the sandbox (which may exist across many computers) it is safe, nomatter what evil things the lambdas may simulate,
and maybe the best that can be done is for different VMs to have a different vm.import function if they want to while NOT allowing evil
higher on the stack (!vm.mask_stackIsAllowImportEvilIds), but while allowing evil it must be deterministic.
It can be a security hole for malicious messages to be able to stop a calculation, like hiding an evil message in a good message by steganography
that is later discovered. While evil is allowed (so maybe there should be 2 bits, to lock in allowing evil while higher on stack, and one to lock it out, higher on the stack)
... while evil is allowed, there is no such way to "throw a wrench into the machine" since such wrenches all already have a unique id, as every lambda does,
	even the unexpected ones... that means that viruses etc that dont even exist yet already have a certain id. All lambdas do. At least,
		if you count the internal 2-way forest nodes as part of the lambda instead of just its param/return mapping.


/*SOLUTION to sandbox problem, though maybe not the fastest, will get musical instruments and flexible recursion in opmut working soon,

	//truncate to nonnegative int n even if its string or lambda or mut etc (which if they are not a double then becomes 0).

	//view as thisMut[abc] or thisMut.xyz where value of abc is 'xyz', and root namespace (in an opmut call) is a Mut (maybe with just 1 key set to the param of opmut??),

but as λg... the good form since if I make the instruments myself out of only things I've made (nobody having given me lambdas to use)
then I know theres no evil in it (evilbit) but just change λg to λe later if combining it with things you cant easily verify are good.
And start playing the instruments something like http://dinahmoelabs.com/plink/ andOr puredata.

This is similar to solveRecog (and solveFloat64) except its easier to optimize and is expected to look wherever lambdas may be stored such as in browser cache, harddrive, a website, or wherever vm.λimport is hooked in to look. Or, it might load a lazyEval of the lambda like a stub that looks for it if you look deeper into it.

stackIsAllowAx (fixme, is it varargAxCall or just axa (and maybe axb?))
varargAxCall //(varargAxCall constraint ...params...) ... (varargAxCall constraint a) is halted if (constraint [(varargAxCall constraint ...paramsExceptLast...) lastParamSoFar])->u, and evals to v if that -> (AnythingExceptU v), so varargAxCall chooses at each next param that it has enough params or not (vararg) and if not then what the return val is. These ax (axiom-like) constraints are a turing-complete-type-system that could for example make a list that can only contain prime numbers, or a tree that can only have a certain type of nodes in it. It takes finite time to compute, just normal forward computing, but cuz of haltingProblem, it takes on average infinity time and memory to verify, so theres a containsAxConstraint bit in header int and a stackIsAllowAx bit on stack thats also in that header int for nonhalted calls/nodes. varargAxCall tightens cleanvsdirty (higher on stack) to be deterministic (ax is deterministic, but so is not allowing ax), so you cant for example have an ax constraint about nondeterministic roundoff or about mutableWrapperLambda.

TODO opcode for optimizing a musical instrument, similar to how in puredata theyre made of parts that each have n inputs and m outputs, of float64s.
use Mut (which has a {} and a Float64Array.
state of an instrument part will be any combo of Muts and float64s, but no strings or lambdas (returns a lambda from the outer Mut/opMut call,
but inside opMut its just evaling javascript code as an optimization, which depends on string, Float64Array, etc,
having none of the same fields as Mut (Mut.m for map and Mut.d for double array) so that would get an undefined and throw instead of getting access to Float64Array.buffer etc.
Thats why Mut separates the map and Float64Array, and why generated code will use amut.m[] and amut.d[] instead of directly amut[].
..
Each musical instrument part will have 3 fields in its state, numbers in, numbers out, and the state it uses for whatever it wants. and maybe a stackTime counter?
These numbers in and numbers out are hooked together by the outer mut, similar to how it happens in puredata.
The musical instrument calculation, of chosen t time cycles (such as WebAudioAPI can do 256 cycles, 512 cycles, etc at once, but lambdas dont send to external sound or video, instead
external stuff would only read lambdas returned after calling lambdas on lambdas) will come in 3 parts:
* verify each musical instrument piece does not allocate anything in last part, and that each is limited to a chosen amount of stackTime in the outer mut call.
* allocate the Float64Arrays and maps and var fields in those maps.
* update state in the mut of this instrument part, such as a double loop with some if/elses and x = {,+ y? z?}.
...
These musical instrument parts are each a transform of numbers in to numbers out, such as 5 in and 3 out,
and can be shared across the internet at near lightspeed and be compiled and running as a sound transform between speakers and microphone before the speed of sound would get there
even if its a short distance, in theory,
as lambdas (normally used with stackIsAllowNondetRoundoff so can use js Math.sqrt Math.sin etc optimizations).
To compile and combine them this fast, each instrument part will be compiled separately (make an evaler (vm,l,r) from a js eval(codeString) derived from the lambdas)
and those multiple evalers will run in sequence in the outer mut call,
so for example, in theory, you could make a loud sound, throw a fourier transform algorithm to a computer thats kind of far away but can still hear the sound,
and that computer compile and run the fourier algorithm in time to hear the sound with it.

TODO write my own opensource license"... most of this probably wont be in it, too indirectly related. mostly it should just say
that theres likely to be dangerous stuff in it like in the dark/deep web so dont let it out of sandbox unless you're a math expert and what could happen if you do,
and that any malicious act by anyone on your computer or resulting things is your fault for letting it out of the sandbox since all possible lambdas are allowed
and are safe inside the sandbox but not necessarily outside it sot he rules for what can be outside it should not apply to inside it
(think of the sandbox like an antivirus quarantine that lets it keep running inside),
(((this part shouldnt go in license: but as long as its in sandbox its safe, and for this reason its in a sandbox in a sandbox, the browser sandbox and inside that an inner sandbox called the wikibinator203 VM)))
and say that nobody owns the lambdas, say that in a copyleft way and explain that they're all derivative works of the universal lambda
since all paths on the left and right childs (lambdas) of each lambda lead to the universal lambda, and for all x, the lambd call (left x (right x)) equals x which makes them similar to quines.
Other than that, just copy some parts of MIT license and GNU GPL license(s), something like that, but keep it small.

		..
		How to use that to make a plain map of key to val?
			Use (? key val) but wrap it in a func that gets the key out instead of using (? key) as a key,
			and do that for get and put etc.
		..
		
		
		
		
		
		
		///OLD, cuz this can be done simpler by having just 1 key type that can be done by KE and KKE and KEC.
		Keys must have .cur of at least 2, cuz val is their next param.

		(KEC key valAsCbtOrMaybeTypevalOfCbt map)->forkEditedMap. Key is (KEC key). For storing double[] int[] etc.
		(KKE keyA keyB val map)->forkEditedMap. Key is (KKE keyA keyB).
		(NormMap map)->forkEditedMap. Makes a nearly completeBinaryTree with at most the last row being incomplete.
		(K? key map) -> val from map, or U if not exist.
		(KK? keyA keyB map) -> val from map, or U if not exist.
		
		HOW I DECIDED ON THAT SOLUTION...
		
		
		Make avl and trie_with_avl, using a single design that varies in params
		(like has a different balance func, same comparator, etc),
		and use that to decide if the extra complexity is worth it vs should i go avl only
		and norm the avl to a completeBinaryTreeExceptDeepestRow as needed.
		...
		Which funcs do I need to implement? (some many be the same both ways, and others need to be params of avl):
		* (Norm map) //returns the same map contents but invariant of the order of inserts/deletes/etc. May be expensive.
		* (Put key val map) or (put (key val) map) where key.n.cur()>1, unsure which of these I'll do.
		* (PutAll mapFrom mapTo) //copy mapFrom's contents into a forkEdit of mapTo, so mapFrom wins if overlap.
		* (Prei key map) //prefix subtree, Inclusive.
		* (Prex key map) //prefix subtree, eXclusive.
		* (Sufs key map) //suffix subtree, Inclusive.
		* (Sufx key map) //suffix subtree, eXclusive.
		* (Has key map) //-> T or F. Can tell the difference between mapped to U and U meaning doesnt contain
			//BUT should the treemap allow keys of U vs remove keys mapped to U since it returns U to mean either way?
				* 
		* (Del key map) //is this the same as 
		* 
		* 
		* 
		//* (ForAll LoopBody map) //where does it accumulate them? map/reduce?
		* 
		* 
		* 
		
		Should there be these few kinds of treemap nodes?...
		* TrieWithExactSortedListAtBottom //is always exactly sorted. if hash func is good enuf, wont be any collisions, but for math correctness, by pigeonhole, must handle possible collisions anyways.
		* Empty_TrieWithExactSortedListAtBottom.
		* AvlLazyNorm
		* EmptyAvlLazyNorm.
		???
		..
		Also, not a node type (since it could reuse some of the other types) but...
			TrieWithNonNormedAvlAtBottom
				This one is probably not useful.
				The 2 useful kinds are TrieWithExactSortedListAtBottom and AvlLazyNorm.
		..
		Maybe Prei Prex Sufs Sufx and Del, should be generalized to a Filter func that
			chooses which keys to keep, and have an optimization for each of those so it does the same thing.
		..
		The 2 useful kinds are TrieWithExactSortedListAtBottom and AvlLazyNorm.
		Theres 3 nonEmpty datastructs in that: trie, list, and avl,
			and all 3 could be done by (Treemap ...fewParams... left (key val) right getKey)->val.
			All 3 are a tree sorted by a given comparator.
		Maybe the "...fewParams..." should contain a comparator but NOT a normer or putter or any other funcs,
			and put those kind of things in the getters setters normers etc funcs???
		((Treemap CompareFirstByIdThenByGodelLikeNumber)#Tm (Tm ...) (KKE a b c) (Tm ...))
			but how would putter (Put (key val) map)->forkEditedMap or (key val map)->forkEditedMap...
				How would putter know which datastruct?
		A nearlyCompleteBinaryTree is a valid avl tree since balance at every node is between -1 and 1.
		
		
		
		
		Start writing wikib user level code for how I want to use the avltreemaps with Fo IfElse Mut etc.
			Where does comparator go?
			
		(Treemap comparator putter left keyval right getkey).
		Do I need putter to be a param of Treemap?
		Do I want a more complex comparator that combines
		max depth n of trie (skipping levels where those bits in id of key are the same in all keys deeper)
		with avl below that, and optionally keeps the avl sorted andOr sorted as a [] list
		so it always stays normed instead of having to be normed after n forks?
		..
		Is there a better way to balance than avl, such as each branch knows its weight in keyvals
		and treerotates when one side is too much heavier than the other?
		AVL is probably close enough to optimal.
		...
		Should there be a max avl height of 255? That would be a very big avl tree,
		maybe holding around 2^128 keyvals (just guessing, havent thought about bigO of avl height vs size much)?
		https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-height-balancedavl-tree/ says "1.44*log2(n) If there are n nodes in AVL tree, maximum height can't exceed 1.44*log2(n)"
		but Im not sure if thats true (TODO).
		...
		Should it be limited to max (around) 2^50 keyvals in each tree, so that float64 can hold its size exactly?
		How about max 2^48-1 or 2^32-1 or 2^31 or something?
		..
		What fn would be an empty Treemap? (Tm U U U), (where I havent decided what params go in Tm yet)?
		If U is a keyval, then key is (F U) and val is U, cuz (L U)->(F U) aka identityFunc, and (R U)->U.
		If you wanted identityFunc as key, you'd instead write it as (KE identityFunc val),
		so in that case the Treemap key would be (KE identityFunc).
		If its instead identityFunc directly, aka the keyval is U,
		could use that similar to null, meaning its not there.
		In general, Treemap will use keyval as (key val), so key must take at least 2 more params,
		since (key val) must be halted. key is also a func to forkEdit a Treemap, to PUT that val at that key,
		so in Fo/While/IfElse/Mut/etc, _[(KKE ballA x 5) (KKE ballA y 2.3)] can be used as a func to
		forkEdit the state (that those loops/ifelse/etc are using) to,
		as you'd write it in javascript for example, ballA.x = 5; ballA.y = 2.3; then return forkEdited state.
		Those (KKE ballA x 5) and (KKE ballA y 2.3) etc are inside Treemap.
		Treemap is sorted by (SomeComparator (KKE ballA x 5) (KKE ballA y 2.3)) -> T or F (or maybe -1 0 or 1?).
		..
		or, instead of Treemap opcode, how about just [] lists inside eachother, that are in sorted order
		by some comparator (as a param somewhere), so [a b c d e] could be [[a b][c [d e]]] or [[a b c d]e] etc.
		Do that???
		Would need some way to know the difference between content in the list/tree vs internal tree nodes.
		Could prefix such content with T which is in some syntaxes written as , aka (T x) is ,x.
		[[,a ,b][,c [,d ,e]]]
		and if d happens to be [hello world] then its... [[,a ,b][,c [,[hello world] ,e]]].
		I like that its more human readable than having specific opcodes for it.
		Also it can be variable branching factor as its displayed, though is still 2 childs per fn.
		...
		Function call caching can handle minKey maxKey contains getHeight etc, recursively and efficiently enough,
		so dont need to store those in the tree itself.
		This could in general do any sorted stuff, not just treemaps.
		..
		(Get comparator key [[,a ,b][,c [,[hello world] ,e]]])
		(Put comparator key val [[,a ,b][,c [,[hello world] ,e]]])
		(ContainsKey comparator key [[,a ,b][,c [,[hello world] ,e]]])
		etcs
		This would even use screen space half-efficiently in the drag and drop tree UI (a html file).
		But if comparator is to be stored with the treemap, then a different order?...
		(Get comparator [[,a ,b][,c [,[hello world] ,e]]] key)?
		Cant do that cuz Fo/While/IfElse/etc take a treemap as the state to forkEdit
		(which they will optimize by using Mut).
		The optimizing process could check that (Get comparatorX) (Put comparatorX) etc are used,
		all with same comparator, and that comparator is (if it can be proven, else dont optimize it) consistent in how it orders all possible fns and always halts... then the comparator doesnt have to be stored with the [...] tree.
		...
		But constant avl branch size might be more efficient.
		
		
		
			
		(Tm#(Treemap comparator balancer) left keyval right getkey).
		(Tm U (KKE x y z) U (KKE x y)) -> z.
		This is general enuf to do avl and trie.
		(KKE x y 5 (Tm U (KKE x y z) U)) ->
			 (Tm U (KKE x y 5) U).
		comparator ruturms T or F (maybe 2 kinds of F, differing in prefix, to say equal or not?) depending if lessthan... Example: GodelLessThan op is a comparator.
		Or do i want to specialize in avl for fewer objects created by balancing while forkediting? How about the Put fn goes where balancer is now? Put can also remove, by val being U?
			
		((Avl Cmp343)#Av left here right getValOfThisKey)

		The avltreemap will be similar to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/NavigableMap.html
		
		Different comparators could compare different ways.
		Some could just compare by idElseGodellikenumber of (KKE a b) in (KKE a b c),
		and others could compare first by a, then by b, if it happens to be a KKE,
		since that would allow searching for fields of an object,
		as KKE is designed for object oriented programming in Mut/IfElse/Fo/etc opcodes.
		
		Use this SOLUTION: avltreemapWithComparatorParam and use fn.n.id()
			(which is small for small strings and at most 32 bytes so maybe size 65 chars as text)
			to compare first, and break ties (hashCollisions) by sorting by GodelLessThan.
			Replace btflGet and btflPut with avlGet and avlPut. Also avlNormTo_completeBinaryTreeExceptForDeepest.
			Rebuild the avl, either by starting empty and inserting all again in same order,
				or by making it a completeBinaryTreeExceptForDeepest kind of norm (which is still a valid avl).
			I'm doing this instead of trie, cuz it normally has less height and is faster to reshape.
			The main use of it will be copying between the Mut/MutLam/Fo/IfElse/etc optimizations and avl state.
			Such a state (an avl tree) can be used with IfElse Fo etc with or without the Mut optimization,
			which I guess will happen without optimization when doing small things,
			and with optimization (Mut.m = {id to Mut} etc) for number crunching, graphics, sound, etc.
			Copy avl code from wavetree on my github.
			Be careful to only optimize if know the comparator always halts and compares consistently,
			cuz if it wouldnt have halted in middle calculations that were done as Mut instead,
			then thats an error to halt. If its the main id function with GodelLessThan breaking ties, thats true.
			In this treemap, have (KE comparator k val) (KEC comparator k cbt) and (KKE comparator a b val).
			The L of all of those is the avl key.
			Maybe also fn, double, and few other types that are in Mut.
		/*...
		OLD... SOLUTION: use avltreemap as the stream datastruct, with GET, PUT, and NORM funcs,
			and it takes param of comparator, and only allow optimizing it with MutLam/IfElse/Fo/etc
			if the VM (not necessarily user level) knows the comparator is consistent.
			GodelLessThan can be such a comparator, which returns T or F for any lambda.
			I could use VarargAx to prove an avltreemap is correct, or i could use funcallcaching to
			check it every time. The latter is simpler.
			A derived (by λ opcode) avltreemap would look something like this...
			(Avl GodelLessThan_orOtherComparator TheHeight LeftAvlOrLeaf RightAvlOrLeaf)
			But since a keyVal can be anything, such as [KKE a b c] or (Avl GodelLessThan ...) etc,
			need a way to specify that a LeftAvlOrLeaf is a leaf vs nonleaf.
			Could do it as 2 (instead of 1) of TheHeight.
			(Avl GodelLessThan_orOtherComparator LeftHeight RightHeight LeftAvlOrLeaf RightAvlOrLeaf)
			For most pairs of heights with a comparator, (Avl GodelLessThan_orOtherComparator LeftHeight RightHeight) will be reused many times, so its still efficient to store this way.
			Could instead use [GodelLessThan_orOtherComparator LeftHeight RightHeight LeftAvlOrLeaf RightAvlOrLeaf]
			but then would need a separate GET function. K? and K?C and KK? are separate get funcs anyways.
			[Comparator LeftHeight LeftAvlOrLeaf RightHeight RightAvlOrLeaf]
			is less efficient but easier for humans to read.
			[Cmp343 LeftHeight [Cmp343 ...] Right [Cmp343 ...]].
			Why put heights in the avl datastruct if not going to put minkey and maxkey?
			Could just do it as [Comp343 [Comp343 ...] [Cmp343 ...]] and use funcallcaching for that.
			Need height there cuz if its 0 then view that child as a keyval instead of another avl,
			OR could put an isAvlLeaf param in (T or F), or have 2 opcodes for it...
			(AvlLeaf Cmp343 AKeyVal) or (AvlLeaf Cmp343 AKey AVal).
			(AvlBranch Cmp343 (AvlLeaf Cmp343 AKey AVal) (AvlBranch Cmp343 ... ...)).
			Comparator/Cmp343 might do a hash to int32 at first, and break ties with GodelLessThan.
			Considering that VarargAx can intheory be verified as it streams in, but requiring recomputing
			every part of it, I could potentially make avl trees that claim they are correct avl trees,
			OR i could just have an AvlVerify func.
			Even if VarargAx does verify the data observed so far in the avl tree,
			that doesnt prove a given comparator (Cmp343 its named here) is consistent or always halts.
			I could accept a limit on comparators to have to be some kind of nand forest
			(even if not stored or optimized that way) that reads nands at each of 2 childs
			to compute some bits (by nands) at self. Can GodelLessThan be defined that way,
			starting with the IsLeaf op? Might also need a HeightLessThan op to do it efficiently.
			But then how does it call itself recursively?
			λ opcode is designed for that but is more complicated than I want to deal with for this simple thing,
			cus it does a linear search and compares lambdas for equality.

		FIXME choose to change order of params here, such as <KE (F U) GetKey GetVal> where (F U) gets the Treemap,
		or choose not to reorder. I was about ready to reorder it that way but then what should it put as key in the treemap,
		since (KE Key) would no longer be a prefix of it? Maybe do it both ways,
		but put (KE Key) and (KKE KeyA KeyB) in the map nomatter which one did it?
		Do I want an op that does the same as <KE (F U)> aka {,KE (F U)} aka (S (T KE) (F U))?
		That being the kind of KE (choose 1, drop the other from VM, TODO) where map is first param not last param.
		Do I want an op that calls (KE key val) on 2 params when its given 1 param? and the
		same param is used twice? (PP (KE key val) map) -> (KE key val map map). That way i could keep map as third param,
		but need <...> instead of (...). (PP <KE GetKey GetVal>)??? That still has the problem of what goes in the map as key,
		is it (KE key) or does it include that theoretical PP op too?
		The best solution so far seems to be the KE op does (KE map key val) -> forkedited map, and to use (<<KE I> GetKey GetVal> map),
		and make some opcodes or just use [...], for what that puts as key in the map. ???
		TODO list out all the depths of recursion that go in the map, and primitive types,
		and solve them all at once here...
		It needs to know bit size of 8 16 32 or 64 bits, but maybe not if 32 is a float vs int, and if 64 is double vs long, etc.
		It needs up to 2 keys, but not 3, cuz (object key value) is enough to recurse things like .a.b.c.def.ghi,
		and in that case it first gets the 'a' key from map, then what that returns gets 'b' key from map, and so on. Thats just a getter.
		vm.Mut will be flat for deduped fn keys (that joined with whichMutCallGroup) are primaryKey of a Mut so Mut as a mutable map of Mut to Mut,
		and nonflat in having an extra depth of Float64Array or Int32Array etc at some js field,
		and having a .dupFn js field, etc (might name these differently), and having a field thats a single mutable float64/double, etc.
		The purpose of these ops is to be a snapshot, in a treemap, of that vm.Mut optimization, and to run it slowly in interpreted mode
		when not using that optimization. Need opcode for each of those things, including such fields in Mut and to modify just a part of an array in Mut
		such as (DE key val Map) should instead be (DE Map key val).
		Need to know if there will be a different js field in Mut for Float64Array vs Int32Array etc, vs will that be a Buffer (js object)
		which those can share and overlap. And is a Mut allowed to have more than 1 such array? The array can be replaced by another array of var size
		at runtime, but probably best not to allow copying ptr to it to have multiple incoming ptrs to it from multiple Muts.
		It should stay as being the array value of that Mut. Size and primType of it must be chooseable at runtimee.

		/*SOLUTION: key is the getter, something like (but choose shorter names) (MutMut keya keyb) (MutD keya) (MutDupFn keya) (MutTypedBlob keya).
		The "change order of params here, such as <KE (F U) GetKey GetVal>" problem exists in alot of the loop/if/read/write ops im still coding,
		including Fo, If (or was it IfElse or Ife?), DE (set the (MutD keya) double val equal to a val), KKE, etc. Should rename some of those.
		Setter for (MutTypedBlob keya) would replace the whole blob at once, but also need setters with an extra int param for which index in the blob
		in units of uint8 int32 float32 float64 (and maybe a few other prim types?), like... (DE map player5sBallX 3.45) or <DEi ,player5sBallX ,3.45>
		where DEi#<DE I#(F U)>. Or something like that. Thats the single number val in a mut (and snapshot of it in treemap).
		The one with extra param might be (DDE map 7 3.45), where D means double/float64, or (todo find better name) if I means int then (DIE map 7.3.45).
		E in these names means set EQUAL to.
		These would usually be viewed, in text form, more like <DE .players.bob.x ,3.45> or maybe even .players.bob.x=,3.45
		where .players.bob.x= is a lambda that takes a map param and a value and returns a forkEdited map,
		but I probably got the number of params or <> vs {} vs () (s-curry-level etc) wrong and need to think about it more.
		.players in vm.Mut optimizations would be js code like "rootMut.idOfTheStringPlayers",
		and .players.bob.x would be js code like "rootMut.idOfTheStringPlayers.idOfTheStringBob.idOfTheStringX",
		but only for keys that wont ever overlap existing keys in the vm.Mut type such as .toString so add a prefix.
		It might end up generating js code like "m.λplayer.λbob.λx = (m.λplayer.λalice.λx*3);" where λalice might be returned by vm.eval('alice').n.id();
		Just tested it, vm.eval('alice').n.id() does return 'λalice'.
		Lambdas that arent short strings without whitespace etc, just give the full 256 bit id prefixed by 'λ'.
		So just use the .id() of the lambda, whatever it is. So variable names can be lambdas in general, not just strings.
		TODO before doing vm.Mut optimization, verify theres no keys that start with λ in vm.Mut,
		and verify that no lambda in the call to be optimized can get the call to be optimized during forkEditing of it (as Treemap states)
		and if it can then run it in slow intepreted mode instead.

		//? [mindmap playerball5 2.34 thethingxyz]
		Or could have those vals be a [] list instead of making a sparse matrix datastruct for it.
		Mindmap might be displayed between many fns/lambdas as a certain color
		of edge (or same color as the node is displayed) but only from the selected node
		cuz otherwises it could be too many edges on screen.
		The listweb mindmap software (newest version in https://github.com/benrayfield/occamsworkspace
		or i have local updates havent put on github in too long as of 2022-8-25)
		will be very important for organizing lambdas cuz its a way to organize many thousands of lists of lists of lists...
		and if x is in y's list then y is in x's list and the lists can be reordered by mouse drag,
		and notes can be written or copy/pasted about any node.
		Imagine dragging fns/lambdas into and out of such lists (including copying them by ptr)
		and gathering thousands of fns over time that you use in various combos.
		But that doesnt necessarily need its own opcodes. The opcodes are already turingcomplete.
		..
		The mindmap is more of a longterm thing. The vm.Mut system is normally for very short times

TODO important...
could hyperquasicrystal's cardinality be counted down from 0 toward -infinity (never reaching it)
(and optionally sorting the integers any way you like such as by height then recursively by left child then recursively by right child?)
???
cuz if so, then cardinality 0 is the highest cardinality.
lazycardinalityeval op would take 4 params: cardinality func param ignore, and edge goes toward (haltsymbol returnVal) or toward doesnthaltsymbol,
	and opCrossRedEdge or opCrossBlueEdge etc point at either where the edge actually points at or at callerdoesnthaveenoughcardinality.
	so the earlier hyperquasicrystal design as usual (and of course only clean (all 3 kinds of clean at once) applies at the higher cardinalities),
		except counts down from max cardinality instead of counts up from lowest cardinality.
PROBLEM???: can this be used to compute a haltingOracle (which are impossible) by emulating self,
	and calling haltingOracle on self to check if (self u) would halt or not then choosing to do the opposite (disproof by contradiction of haltingOracles)?
Since there would be an opGetCardinalityOnStack, it wouldnt be an actual emulation of self???
But since cardinality exists only on stack...
But what if a call of doesItHaltAtLowerCardinalityThanCaller never returns? By definition it must return (haltsymbol returnVal) or doesnthaltsymbol or callerdoesnthaveenoughcardinality,
and by definition a lazycardinalityeval must have a redEdge toward (haltsymbol returnVal) or doesnthaltsymbol (and cant have such an edge toward callerdoesnthaveenoughcardinality).
(doesItHaltAtLowerCardinalityThanCaller someCardinality func param) just checks if (func param), at someCardinality, halts or not and if it halts what does it return.
But doesItHaltAtLowerCardinalityThanCaller should actually be a derived node, derived from redEdge etc.
I'm unsure if this is consistent, but if it is, I'm likely to want the cardinality design back in hyperquasicrystal.
Try to disproveByContradiction in it. Try to prove (isleaf (u u)) or true=false or something like that.
What if cardinality is infinite in both directions, a kind of unaryNumber that ranges between -infinity (exclusive) and infinity (exclusive) of the integers between?
	I could easily make such a number type by just having 2 kinds of unary number, one for negatives and one for nonnegatives, and a +1 and -1 op etc.

	isDirtyRoundoff //allow Math.sin(double) Math.tanh(double) etc, vs those funcs always infloop and you only get

FIXME its 4x2: stackIsAllowstackTimestackMem, stackIsAllowNondetRoundoff, stackIsAllowMutableWrapperLambdaAndSolve, stackIsAllowAx.
FIXME should be 3x2 levels of clean/dirty, instead of 2x2. mutableWrapperLambda and solve* are above the level of just allowing spend/stackTime/stackMem.



TODO should it be ?varname optionally, if you want to give vars names? not sure how i'd optimize that, but it would just be (opOneMoreParam varnameorcomment func).
Example: (lambda funcBody ?abc j ?ddee?ghi k xyz).
Instead of getParam7 getParam22 it could be (ddee? (pair (lambda funcBody ?abc j ?ddee?ghi k) xyz))->k .
ddee? would be a syntax for (getnamedparam "ddee").
wont hurt to include it, even if it ends up not being used, cuz could just use  (opOneMoreParam u func).

vararg using opOneMoreParam such as (lambda funcBody ?? a b ??? c d e) -> (funcBody (pair (lambda funcBody ?? a b ??? c d) e)),
and (a b ?? c) means (opOneMoreParam (opOneMoreParam (a b)) c) but is displayed as (a b ?? c).
curriesLeft is counted up to 254 and above that it means "more than 254" so have to count it by lambda call (will get cached in a double but the ids just store 8 bits of it).

levels of clean: clean, allowSinTanhSqrtRoundoffEtc, allowSpendEtc..orJustCallItDirty

TODO make this fast. its a variant of wikibinator202 that has these changes:
* will code audivolv, augmentedballs, neuralnets, canvas graphics, webaudioapi, jsoundcard that thing where it hears you whisper from across the room speaker microphone feedback, etc, in this system asap. have fun.
* theres only halted lambdas stored, 2 childs each.
* built in ed25519 op for mutableWrapperLambda, used with spend call andOr an op to say if it has an answer yet, but only in twothirdsdirty on stack.
* async opcode to prepare to do something, get the call started in a forked greenthread or thread etc, and another op to check if such a call is done, in progress, etc. also only in twothirdsdirty.
* no wiki op since it would tend toward things becoming less standardized, and the spend and mutableWrapperLambda etc ops will have their own opcodes.
* separate funcallcache (func param return touchtime) and binary forest of funcs. use same 4 ints of localid per node as in wikibinator202, 2 ints for idA and idB and 2 ints for start and end of Int32Array.
* salt128 on stack will only be unitary transformed, and that will be done by mutableS-like fns cuz they're so fast, using ops like << + & etc, to read any 2 of the 4 ints and write 1 of the others, or deeper binary forests of int int -> int ops.
* has a GPU.js opcode that tells it to use float32 etc instead of doubles, and with the strangeness of GPU.js opcodes recursively inside.
* has all the js Math funcs such as sine tanh
* has all the js operators on doubles such as * / ** - & | <<.
* has onethirdclean and twothirdsclean levels, instead of clean and dirty, and these levels only allow access to the 4 ints of salt on stack and (spend maxstackTime maxstackMem func param) and getstackTime and getstackMem and getestimatedeconacycmemcost(...by some combo of fulleconacyc zapeconacyc andor recent use of stackMem...).
* theres no vararg but theres up to around 126 or maybe 63 params, with an opcode for each. make it 63, and have space for 64 other opcodes, so o8.
* same mutableS-like abc.def[mutmap]<mutdouble>={+ {* abc[x] ,3}} syntax, which is a function that in an opmut call does 3 gets and a 3-way put like a[b]=c, or 2way like a=c.
* bitstrings are limited to 2^31-1 bits, so bize fits in int.
* blobs are wrappers of Float64Array of powOf2Size, still immutable??? a double/float64 is itself as an object and doesnt need to be converted. blobs can still be viewed as left and right childs of half their size recursively, down to a double. Or maybe still use Int32Array?
* derive IF func used like this { ... (if {...condition...} {iftrue} {iffalse}) ...} notice the IF is in () aka normalCall inside {} aka sCall. the IF function is (if condition iftrue iffalse state) and calls (condition state) and gets a t or f from it (todo what if its neither?) then based on that calls (iftrue state) or (iffalse state), therefore theres less nodes and more efficient than the equals functions derived in earlier universal functions. Do similar for FOR and WHILE and DOWHILE etc loops and PROGN etc.
* syntax: () is normal call. {} is sCall. [] is mutmapget. <> is mutmapdoublearrayget (or put in some cases).
